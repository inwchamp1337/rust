I ordered the chicken jerk sandwich with a side salad, absolutely loved it!  The chicken had the perfect amount of spice to it which was off set with sweet with the pineapple chutney it had on it, sooo good!  The salad was even great because they used real green spring mix instead of iceburg lettuce.  I also loved that they put feta cheese on top, its one of my favorite cheeses for salad topping!  Service was great here and even though I didn't have a drink here that night I have a previous time and they are yummy!

It's been a long, happy union.While Olive or Twist is NOT a five star restaurant, it gets 5 stars from me because I love it.  Its one of the few places I know of that has been CONSISTANTLY good.  for years!  The interior is warm and a little bit industrial.  The downstairs is the same as it has always been and it's still very nice.The drinks are great although the first martini I ever had (a girl doesn't forget!  [well,this one didn't]) was a Pineapple Upside Down martini and I don't think they offer that anymore but they do have a very expansive martini menu.  I tried the chipotle martini and it was so excellent that when I took my first sip I sighed in a way my bf turned to me and sarcastically said, \"Oh, you're going to be Yelping about that, aren't you\"  Then, I refused to let him even try it bc it was that good.  It was MINE.I also had a cake batter martini which tasted great and came out looking so pretty I instagrammed a picture of it and immediately all my friends clicked like on it, and my one aunt commented I should drink less.  Whatever. She needs a martini.The service was great.  Our waitress, Lauren, was really cool and very good at recommending the drinks--the chipotle martini was her recommendation, I would never had ordered that on my own.We had the buffalo chicken dip which was served in a martini glass and it was really good.My favorite thing on the menu there is the tomato basil bisque soup and it has been rocking my lunch hour for the past ten years.  It's delicious.  Its so good that Lauren and I actually high fived when she brought it out.  (true story.)My bf had the chicken caprese wrap and said it was excellent, it was gone within minutes so that is a good sign.I highly recommend this place for lunch, after dinner cocktails, or a date.  This is one of my favorite downtown lunch spots!","product_id":"1","review_rating":5}

They don't have a kids menu, so I can't call the restaurant \"family friendly,\" but everyone was really friendly to our family. The owner even stopped by once or twice to pinch our son's cheeks.

It wouldn't work if you don't live there so I tuned out on the details. I don't know why we even bother with the strip. Get off the strip, people. See the real Vegas.

Everyone here is very polite (you won't get hounded for a dance the second you sit down).  The environment is very nice, classy, and CLEAN.  Their VIP area upstairs is top notch and always a great time.  Make sure to check out the bar at the top of the stairs, which IS open to the public.

Been coming here for years and I never get tired of it.  You get mardi gras beads as you walk in and immediately after someone is there to get you a drink.  A couple of minutes later you are gaming, drinking and having a great time, and occasionally you really do win money and I mean real money, no tickets here so don't put a hundred in and then try to cash out, you'll be so loaded down with nickels and quarters you won't be able to walk.The drinks are strong, the slots are decently loose and the manager Barbara and the cashier Mary Ellen are so cool, make you feel so welcome.  The Russian cocktail waitress is really nice too and trust me, she'll be back to check on your drink before you can sip down the one you have.This is one thing I miss about Vegas, the free drinks to keep you there.  Most places don't give them away unless you're at a $1 machine and even then not usually.  So, La Bayou has my business two times a year, every year.

(however, we did find Ellis Island nearby and enjoyed that for what it is! see my review)I really wanted to make sure my sons went down to Fremont where I knew we'd end up in Bayou so we came Sunday after breakfast (Omelette House- divine!) .  I've been here before (of course, back in 2001 I think the daiquiris were about 13 the price!).  I really don't enjoy gambling, but I do like to sit at a REAL coin-op slot machine and pull the arm of the one-armed bandit with my own hand.  There is something very satisfying about plunking coins in and hearing your winnings clink into the tray.  A classic Vegas experience that is hard to come-by today. I truly hope they NEVER get rid of those machines!  It's a friendly place and a must-visit stop on Fremont.  We had a blast and were only sorry that we couldn't come at night and get they whole \"Experience!\"   We will be back!*note to self:  The drinks are stronger than they look.

Not here!  I walked up, got some Mardi Gras beads and before I could sit down they asked me what I wanted to drink.  I hadn't gotten half way done and she are offering me another drink.  These ladies usually come by about once every 10 minutes so drink fast and get your moneys worth.  By the way, these aren't pussy drinks either - you can taste the alcohol.Their slot machines are usually pretty loose (not this time but usually).  The machines are retro coin payers so don't be looking for slots with tie ins to the latest movies or TV shows and be sure to have a cup or two handy for your big win.Like I said before, I'm still loving Barbara (manager) and Mary Ellen (cashier).

La Bayou offers REAL nickel slots, frozen daiquiris, FREE drinks (if you are gambling, but it's nickel slots), and a dive-bar atmosphere. Upon arriving you are greeted by two ladies dresses in traditional vegas show girl feathers who hand out beads to customers. The beads really add to the kitsch environment of Fremont Street and La Bayou. You are also handed a lottery ticket to enter to win up to $10,000, which was another source of free entertainment. The machines themselves work very well and it was so much fun playing actual coins and seeing them clink into the coin return tray. The waitresses were very attentive and friendly( Remember to TIP). I never had to worry about asking for another drink and the drinks were STRONG.

Whether you have to beg, borrow or video poker your way to the bargain $12 that this thing costs...DO IT.  If you like vodka (in my case LOVE vodka), or even if you don't, this is the cocktail to end all cocktails. It's got something close to 5 shots in it plus a float of stoli elite (5 different kinds of vodka).  But it gets better...the drink doesn't taste like vodka.  It tastes like a delectable cranberrylimefizzy thing that won't give you so much as a buzz.  It comes with a mutant-looking candie cinnimon stick that's a great touch.  Well worth it.  It's a vegas must-have.  Other than the drink, the bar is nifty- great decor (former USSR, the out-front statues head inside the frezzer, and bartops of ice).  Food is great but EXPENSIVE. The other drinks are great too...and I think they're fairly priced for the selection of vodkas, strength of drink and originality.","product_id":"9","review_rating":5}

Dean Cain and the guy that owns the Ivanko barbellcompany have a vodka locker there.

{"review_title":"Mandana K, Dave H and myself wandered around Mandalay...","review_body":"Mandana K, Dave H and myself wandered around Mandalay looking for any bar to be open at 3:30 in the afternoon.  We stumbled upon a statute of a beheaded Lenin, signaling the entrance to the Red Square, which didn't open until 4 PM.  Once 4 arrived, we were the first to walk into the bar that day, taking seats at the bar, which is made out of ice.  Since this is a Russian-themed bar, they stock a wide assortment of vodkas.  On their menu, they had pages and pages of specialty vodka drinks.  We decided to each order different drinks so that we could sample each others.  Since there were only a few other patrons, we learned about the history of the place.  When the bar first opened, the bar generated a lot of controversy with the Russian community because of the statute of Lenin -- head attached -- and the perceived romantacizing of Communism.  The bar caved -- or maybe it was really a great publicity ploy -- and decided to behead Lenin in a public ceremony.  The head now resides inside a block of ice in the vodka locker, a walk-in, sub-zero freezer that stores premium vodka for their clients; it's so cold that before you enter, you need to don a thick, russian like fur coat and hat.  We toured the locker, knocked back a shot of vodka, and read the names of those who rented shelf space inside the locker.  For several thousand dollars a year, one can rent a space, store any vodka you please, have a name plate, and enter the locker any time you please.  Not a bad deal if split among the three of usWe continued to order drinks off the menu until we knocked back every single drink on the menu.  We looked around.  Just as we entered the bar as their first patrons, we exited as their last.  It was 4 AM.","product_id":"2","review_rating":4}

Easily some of the best mixed drinks that I've ever had the pleasure of downing.I started off with a chocolate martini from the dessert menu, since their kitchen was closed and I still needed something sweet to finish off dinner. It was smooth without being overly cloying or creamy. Very drinkable and deliciously chocolatey. They even floated a white chocolate red square in the drink. Nice touch. I'm a lightweight, so that one martini was enough for me, but I did get to try some of my friends' drinks. The Chernobyl will knock you on your butt if you aren't careful, but it tastes like a yummy, barely alcoholic, fruit drink. You won't know what hit you until it's too late. They also have an outstanding black cherry vodkapinot noir martini that is really unique. I can't remember the name of it, but it's worth scouring the menu for. The decor is elegant but cheesy, and the booths are the best spot to sit and people watch. We were there from about 1:30am-2:30am on a Friday night and it was easy to grab some good seats and it was easy to chat without having to shout.","product_id":"6","review_rating":5}

I'm a Gibson fan (vodka martini w onion) so I asked the bartender what brand he recommended for a his favorite vodka martini served up..  I was introduced to Zyr (still not available in California) and this has since been my favorite brand.. Its filtered 9 times and distilled 5 times and it is smooth as water.  You can find distributors selling this on the internet - I've been getting it shipped to my house ever since my last Vegas trip..  :)  I'm heading out there again this weekend and will definitely make a stop into this place.  Food and apps are tasty, nice presentation, pricey (then again everything in vegas is a bit pricey)..decor is very cool with an overwhelming \"red\" theme and the top of the bar is actually made out of 1 huge ice block.  So if you set a drink on it it'll frost up and stay cold.  They have quite an extensive original martini list, most of them fruity.  They allow you to head back into the walk-in freezer with a fur coat if you are into that.  Overall great spot!  Love hitting this place up in the early evening..","product_id":"4","review_rating":3}

Coming upstairs to walk into the medley of lights and fiber optics was simply amazing. It was more of an upscale version of Rain. It has a beautiful view of the Vegas Skyline. What got to me was the floors being lit up. The tables are metal with a mirrored finish. It kinda made me feel like a pervert watching girls dance on it...BUT WHO CARES! The dance floor is huge and the patio area is just amazing. Moon's roof has a huge video screen kinda like the Fremont St Experience but this roof is supposed to retract. That night it didn't due to the slight sprinkling. Moon also has a second floor with another bar and another patio access. I had a great time there.

Well, okay - so we did bottle service for the boys, and for the girls - we got ourselves in but it took all of 15 seconds.   The management, bouncers and serversbusboys were all FABULOUS.  EXCELLENT service all around, I'd give it 10 stars if i could.   Every single person working at Moon that I had to deal with or talk to on this night was nothing short of stellar, and the treatment they gave us was  first-class all around.  The way they had us enter was straight through the Playboy Lounge, and what I saw of that place, I was not impressed.  Head up the escalators to Moon and then voila - - - your night begins and all of Moon is conducive to having a good time.  We ended up getting a table in a separate VIP lounge area, a good distance away from the dancefloor which made it possible to talk as well as drink in private.  There are booths everywhere - and all of  them were nicely set up and comfortable, well-placed, etc.  But I never like sitting too close to the dancefloor where people are falling into your table, or you can't even hear yourself think, so this was perfect.  When you opt for bottle service at Moon, the service leaves you wanting for nothing, nothing at all!  To make a reservation, there is a form to fill out and you do have to hold with your CC unless they know you.  It was relatively easy, and even those in our party who were late got in without a glitch just by mentioning the name under which I'd made reservations.  Very smooth process.Great music, great crowd, and a gorgeous club, to boot.  The patio area outside was fabulous - - view of the whole city, and lots of perfect photo opps out there.  Take a drink outside and get your groove going, come inside and dance the night away.  I would not have minded having a table outside reserved, and might do that the next time I am in Vegas.Three bottles later - - we were all nicely toasted, and I think everyone could agree that it was a great time.  FYI:  Don't pass out.  If you pass out cold in a drunken stupor - they will ask that you be escorted out.  One of my friends had just this happen to him, and when I came back from dancing - - he was gone.  Hahahaha....I'd go back to Moon at any time without any hesitation.

Where are we going and why don't I know about this placeOnce we made it inside and up the long set of stairs (I can see myself taking a digger down these after a few Manhattens) you enter the dark, semi smokey bar. This place is divey but not dirty. It just looks they decorated it about 25 years ago and if it was good enough then, damnit its good enough now. The juke box is loaded with classic jazz and blues and normally operates at the guidance of the bartender (which is fine by me, he has good taste.)The bartender is one of those guys whose career has been behind the bar. He makes his drinks fast, tall, and strong. The average cocktail (whiskey and coke, vodka and juice, gin and tonic) run about $6 and some of their others (Manhattan, martinis, etc) cost $8. The prices are higher than some may be used to, but relax, its worth it. You are getting a rocks glass with little ice, filled nearly to the top with your booze of choice, and a mist of whatever else you wanted to water down the drink. If I'm going to spend $15 in a bar I would rather drink 2 well made, strong drinks than drink 15 cups of coke each with an eye dropper's worth whiskey.

Mardi Gras also has a perfect nostalgic feeling to it.  The wall across from the bar is lined with several large booths that easily accommodate a group of five or six and invite conversation over your stiff drinks.The bar is cash only, which may seem like a little deterrent, but after you've had a couple mixed drinks you'll probably thank yourself for not being able to charge away too many more.

We are constantly on the hunt for best \"bar burger\" (so we have a lame hobby...whatever, it's fun!) and we agree that Villa Tap is one of the best bar burgers in town. Jenny St ground chuck, fresh veggies on the burgs, good bun, also they have good apps (love the cheddar broccoli bites)...all good so far. Good Bloody Mary's too. We haven't tried the fish fry yet, but it's on the to-do list. We actually went there for Valentine's Day - wanted to avoid the crowds, in the mood for a good cheeseburger, etc - had a great time. The burgers were top-notch, jukebox is great (they have a weird abundance of live Dead, which is great). The regular customers are nice and friendly also - it's not an intimidating \"townie-bar\" (hello, Tip Top!) but the regulars are SO nice and fun to talk to. Owner Chico is really nice, and we love that he's going out of his way to buy local ingredients and beer. He's got House of Brews on tap even! Unusual fact - the inside of the bathroom stalls are painted with chalkboard paint and have chalk available to write messages. We really don't have complaints at this point. We're excited to try their brunch soon!","product_id":"10","review_rating":4}
{"review_title":"If you are looking for a no frills Friday night fish fry...","review_body":"If you are looking for a no frills Friday night fish fry that will blow your mind, this is your place. I am giving this place 5 stars because it is wonderful for a very simple meal, with excellent service.  We had a little trouble finding the door (the entrance is in the back facing away from Packers Ave.) but once we walked in and sat at one of their wobbly tables, we were instantly greeted by our friendly server.  Though the bar was busy, we got our drinks immediately, along with a basket with two basic white bread rolls and coleslaw.  All very standard issue.  The fish was another story. Whoa.  I got the Canadian perch and my boyfriend got the Canadian walleye.  The large single piece of walleye was lightly breaded and fried perfectly.  It was buttery, non-fishy, and totally delicious.  The baked potato that came with it was pretty standard, but good.  The perch was battered differently in a thicker, more crunchy coating.  The little strips were just AMAZING.  I got a pile of 7 or 8 strips that I honestly couldn't stop eating.  The fries were done to perfection as well.  My boyfriend and I are somewhat light eaters in general, but we cleared out all of that fried goodness in one sitting.  On the way out the cooks from the back yelled good bye, the bartender wished us a good night, and someone standing by the door smiled and asked us to come back soon.  I can't say enough about how friendly everyone here is.  It looks like a burned out biker bar, but their simple menu is done right.  I never thought I would like a place so much that doesn't have salad on their menu, but I anticipate we will be back many many more times.","product_id":"10","review_rating":4}

I have been going to this place for about one year.  The first time we went later around 9 pm or so and a lot of the fish was gone.  I had an amazing hamburger instead, meat from Jenifer St Market. Besides the first time, I have always gotten the fish.  The perch is amazing and be sure to get the loaded baked potato.  The craft beer selection is impressive.  Chico-the owner is usually cooking, it's a small kitchen, so be prepared to wait, but it's worth it. My fiance usually gets the walleye and loves it. It's now my go to place for fish!","product_id":"5","review_rating":5}

It's a neighborhood bar in the truest sense of the word, locals walk and bike to the place which is situated in one of the greatest areas of Madison.  The food is really nice, an up-scaled bar menu.  The signature dish, the \"Walnut Burger\" is truly fantastic.  Forget about it as a meat-alternative, this burger is a unique creation all its own that will make you have desperate cravings.  The space is large, divided in two, one half the main bar area and the other a large space with family-style tables where groups gather and bands sometimes play at night.

It's cheap, the food is delicious and you get EXTREMELY large portions. I probably have tried everything on their menu from one time to another and they definitely do a better job with certain dishes than others. But the ones they do well can't be beat. The Top 5 things are: 1. Chicken Fingers - These things are the sizes of your forearm and come with a great honey mustard sauce. Bet you can't finish a 5-piece! 2. Gyro - I love their gyro's! Even though you have Zorba's and Niro's Gyros close by I would still go with Geo's if not just for their shear size! You can fill up just on eating off the top of the pile of meat before even making it to the pita bread! 3. Calzones - They have so many different ones to choose from but I would say the Fighting Illini, the Italiano, and the Steak Bomb top the list. Again, these things are massive so be prepared for leftovers! 4. Baked Mostaccioli - Amazing pasta dish with a layer of melted cheese across the top! I would recommend getting it with meat sauce and some sausage or meatballs in there as well. 5. Godfather Sandwich - Don't settle for the regular Italian Beef or you are just shorting yourself for no reason. With the Godfather you get a huge Italian beef with melted cheese on GARLIC bread. So good! The only downside with this place is you have to be ready for a wait if you're going around dinner time or after the bars close because it gets packed. But at the same time you know it's good if there's a line out the door every night!  I miss you Geovanti's!","product_id":"5","review_rating":4}

Someone who helps you - no matter your size or height, finds you the pants that fit your body, the dress shirts, the jackets, etc.  This man was absolutely STELLAR!  Incredibly personable and he knew his job well.  The BF left with exactly what he needed and I may or may not have talked him into a few other items...

Best of all, when I asked if they could ship the suits to me at my house since I no longer live in Pittsburgh, they asked when I was leaving town and promised they would get it done for me before I left  the next day. Better yet, they had the suit ready for me early, avoiding the rush for me to pick it up before I left.

Richard is a collector, a curator, a Pittsburgh god of vintage.  He hand selects every piece in the shop and will not sell anything if a seam is ripped, a button or belt is missing, or if it's just stupid. He has every item laundered and pressed to perfection.  Everything is a gem, and Richard will tell you a bit about where he got the piece and why its design is important.  PRICEY!!  gawd.  Everything at Eons is a bargain for the quality you are getting.Growing up on Eons' vintage has spoiled me for any other vintage store.  I hold every other one up to its standards.

It remains the best vintage store in Pittsburgh, and possibly the best vintage place I've been to period.

We worked with Jack, who assisted us beyond our expectations. It turned out that we could buy suits for all of the groomsmen for less than a tux rental would cost. This meant that our wedding party got to keep their suits after the wedding and use them for business or other purposes - they were theirs! Jack assisted us in picking out the perfect shirts and ties, which we gifted to the groomsmen as our wedding gift. I don't think we could have picked out anything ourselves that would have worked as well as what he helped us find.Everyone looked great, and the best part was that they got to walk away from the wedding with a brand new suit, shirt, and tie for less than the price that they would have spent to rent a tux. And I've returned a tux many times after being a part of a wedding party - often not a fun thing to do the morning after before you catch a flight out of town.Jack has continued to be a great resource, alerting me to sales and helping me pick out what's best for my business attire even after wedding. I used to be a solely Brooks Brothers guy when it comes to dress shirts, mainly because I travel a lot and value the non-iron shirts that BB offers (I HATE ironing shirts). But Jack introduced me to lines that Men's Wearhouse carries and the non-iron shirts there are just as good if not better than those at Brooks Brothers. Though a bit pricey at about $85-95shirt normally, Men's Wearhouse offers frequent 2 for 1 sales that make these shirts a bargain at $42-47.I can't speak about anyone other than Jack (he seems to always be there!), but I can't recommend him or this store highly enough.

The exact size that we needed was not available in the store, however, they were happy to order it for us and it was in within about a week.  They do alterations on site, so you don't need to worry about the suit being sent offsite and they take about two weeks to get done (they will rush them for you if needed - we had the time).

I was very impressed with the sales associate, Emmett, who was incredibly friendly and helpful. After getting measured for the tailoring, Emmett told me that it would take until (I think) Thursday. I explained that I would need the suit a bit sooner than that. Emmett was very accomodating and arranged for it to be available Tuesday. Perfect!Emmett was also great in that when I explained my budget constraints, he didn't try to upsell me (which has happened before) and he didn't leave me when he found out that I wasn't a big spender.I like the way I look in the suit, which is also important. But it's the high standard of excellent service that has won me as a client for as long as I need suits. Bottom line, gentlemen, if you need a suit, go talk to Emmett.","product_id":"4","review_rating":4}

I have an appreciation for sales techniques and I am a tough critic. I was greeted immediately by a man named Alex Parsons with a smile. He was dressed sharp and was very clean cut. He asked a few qualifying questions which I appreciated. I had brought in an expensive pair of shoes with me in hopes to find a belt to match. He asked for the shoe and immediately found a great belt in my size. He then asked if I would be interested in a pair of slacks to try it on with. (which was a seamless transition into an upsell... much appreciated) but the important thing to note... he asked not told. I said absolutely I would. He pulled around 6 options and continued to explain the different materials as well as styles. I decided on a flat front pair of pants made of whool. (great quality as well) I asked for a shirt to complete my ensemble. Unfortunately I have a difficult body frame and have a difficult time finding the correct fit and size. He even went to the trouble of asking the tailor to take a look. I felt like I was getting royal treatment and Alex spent a great amount of time with me, answering all of my questions, and meanwhile tidying up the store and giving me space. I decided to purchase the slacks, with a permanent crease, and had them hem the slacks as well. I was out the door with a new belt, a pair of great slacks and shoe pollish to boot! Thank you Alex for all of your great work. I have already referred a co-worker and he purchased two pairs of slacks and two shirts. The Tempe Marketplace store is fantastic, but more importantly, Alex was fantastic. I would prep him for a promotion if I was in management because he has all of the qualities of a manager. If anyone is reading this and thinking of purchasing from this location, call and ask for Alex. He really suprised me because many of the reviews are so-so. He was unlike any other associate at nordstrom or macys (which is where I usually get my clothing) Call and set an appointment with him, you won't regret it!Thanks again, Alex Danesi","product_id":"9","review_rating":4}

They got me in, and out in about 30 minutes for the initial meeting.  They explained all the options, pricing, etc.  Very professional.  The \"kid\" (probably 22) didn't provide much assistance or recommendations...but the other staffers that assisted me did.  This part of the review I would give 4 stars - slightly better than average serviceetc.  1 star deducted because I HAVE to pick up the tux 2 days before the wedding and not the day before.Popped in there this past weekend for the fittingmeasurements - was in and out in 5 minutes!  But then I decided to browse (bc using the voucher towards a new suit vs the free tux).  Emmett H. - was there to assist me. I didn't think I needed assistance (bought many suits in my life) - but Emmett was great.  He has a calm professional demeanor about him.  He was very knowledgeable about all the suits and the origins, fabric, stitching, etc.  Very very helpful.  He then helped me look at this fantastic suit - Italian made, imported wool, German stitching style - Top Notch.  I can't wait to pick it up.  Emmett said he has 2 (I believe) FT Tailors on-hand and can have the alterations done relatively quickly (permitting demand).  I think Emmett is my new Suit-Guy in AZ!Overall - 4.5 stars.

Recently, the owner reached out to me after reading review. He regretted the situation and wanted to make it right.I have a back log of clothes that need to be altered so I was happy to meet with him again. I knew he could be trusted with the more complicated items (i.e. anything other than pants that need hemming) because of the work he did for me previously.This time I had two dresses taken in at the shoulders and a pair of jeans taken in at the waist. The first dress had embroidery at the shoulders so he did an \"easy fix\" that involves folding the material. I was a little hesistant at first, but it looks good and fits even better. I've never had jeans taken in before so I was worried how they would turn out. Now my beloved mint jeans fit perfectly with just two small darts sewn in the back. They aren't really noticable, and besides, I usually wear my shirts untucked anyways.All the work was ready when promised.

They said they had a silver tie but it might not match exactly. At this point I'm like \"a silver tie that doesn't exactly match is waaaaay the heck better than NO tie\".When I got there an EXTREMELY nice saleslady informed me that they had the exact silver tie over at another store and she would be happy to:1. Give me the almost-but-not-perfectly-matching silver tie so I could get back to the church to get to my usher duties and2. Drive up to the store that had the exact matching tie and then drive over to the church to DELIVER IT...Now, like most folks, I don't love asking people I don't know for favors and this was A LOT to ask for a tie, but I've heard brides can be particular about stuff pertaining to their weddings so I figured since she was willing then erroring on the side of safety would be a good way to go. so I left with the one tie to do my usherly duties and a bit later, the unbelievably kind sales lady showed up at church with the legit tie.  Wow... this was so far above and beyond what I've come to expect from anyone in business, I'm still kind of thinking that that will probably never happen again...OH yeah, I forgot... they did all of this for free. I didn't have to pay extra for the tie or her time to run get it. Nada.Anyways, like I said... 6 stars plus a bag of chips.","product_id":"3","review_rating":3}

Not only do they have a completely renovated downstairs weight room, a number of racquetball and handball courts, row upon row of exercise bikes, treadmills and elliptical machines, but they also have top notch classes, trainers and programs.

The women's locker room has a great little work out area of it's own, nestled right in between the lockers and only a few feet away from the showers.  It's perfect for when you need to be in and out, or if you just enjoy working out in a smaller area.  There is a sweet spot for treadmills on the 3rd floor.  They face out so you can watch joggers run up E. Morehead and think about how much harder they are running then you are, as you run in place.

From their class selection to workout equipment to friendly staff, you can't beat this gym. With a reasonable monthly fee that gives you access to all the YMCAs in Charlotte, this gym is the best bang for your buck. In terms of classes, the Total Strength and Roc-it Circuit Training are great if you like direction when doing any sort of strength training. The Pilates, Yoga, Cardio Dance and Cycle instructors are all quite helpful and make you feel comfortable whether you're a first-timer or partake in a class every day. Only class that gave me pause was Athletic Conditioning - instructor bellowing orders at me over loud speakers for 60 minutes just isn't my cup of tea - but it is apparently a great workout as people come out of it drenched in sweat. I've very rarely seen an \"out-of-order\" sign on any equipment, and with multiple floors (including weight and cardio equipment in the ladies locker room), you hardly ever have to wait for a machine. Staff is uber-helpful and always cheery no matter what time of the day. Fair warning: parking can be a bit difficult in the evenings, and is downright ridiculous in January with all the newcomers. So if you're trying to make one of the multiple group exercise classes, give yourself extra time to park to save yourself some stress.

They have a beautiful lounge area that reminds me of a lounge area on a cruise ship. Tons of comfy seats, windows and free wi fi too! Free wifi at the gym Yes, I totally go to the YMCA to get my wi fi on. They also have a cafeteria-esque food joint. I can do that because of the spacious locker rooms they have. They have lockers you can rent out on the monthly or bring your own lock and use one of the daily use ones. In the women's locker room they have the standard showers, whirlpool, sauna, steam room but they also have a separate workout room down there complete with cardio machines, machines and free weights. Their showers are bigger than the ones at my house which is pretty small so I can go workout, shower, dry my hair, go to the lounge and \"lounge\" with free wifi for a couple of hours.

I walked into the locker room just to check out the machines (imagining a treadmill next to the shower) and was SHOCKED.  And I really do mean I was floored.  The Women's locker room has to be about 2,000 sq ft!  It's enormous!  There is basically a Women's gym inside the locker room!  I fell in love.  Lockers, a Jacuzzi, showers, mirrors to get ready, hair dryers, a cardio room, changing rooms, weight machines, yoga mats, a tv, and more!  Holy crap, did I just die and go too gym-heaven!Needless to say I didn't actually make it out of the Women's locker room to see the rest of the building.  In my defense, I didn't really need to.  They had everything I needed right there!  What a wonderful place!  I will definitely be back!","product_id":"8","review_rating":5}

It's obvious right away that the Dowd is a VERY popular place - for good reason. Although parking came be very limited, arriving with that expectation makes coming here at 5:30pm every other day much easier to swallow. This gym is flat out awesome. Many different rooms, great free weight area, great nautilus section, hybrid machine section, etc.But, the best part about the Dowd, for me, is the lengthy class schedule. Every day of the week, many throughout the day, and very accommodating to different sections of the body. Spin classes are awesome, just make sure to sign up for a bike early - they will and always do fill up. Convenient location on Morehead, close to many other parks in the area, and pretty easy to get in and out of. Overall, I love it here and couldn't recommend it enough!","product_id":"1","review_rating":5}

College st. address unless it's for mailing purposes only, because they is nothing that a new, unfamiliar visitor can use knowing this address that will help you find this Bat Cave. The address on the outside of the building says something TOTALLY different, and unrelated to '301' 'College' or 'St'. But, after calling the staff help me via telephone to find their location. I was very impressed with the facility and its cleanliness. All cardio equipment has there own cleaning spray and towels, which is very convenient, in that you don't have to walk all around trying to find out where the cleaning materials are located. I also took the Body Pump class with Sue M. and another young lady. The class was great and I'd suggest others to take it as well.Also, I got a chance to watch the Zumba class (instructor by Ms. B (*I can't remember her name at the moment))..but it looked very entertaining to say the least.Great job to the staff I'll definitely recommend this facility and will consider returning to it on my next Charlotte, NC visit.","product_id":"1","review_rating":4}

But so far, I like what I see and I see myself being a regular here.I was familiar with Neos because of the funny radio commercials I heard on KissFM while driving to work.  I now have Sirius because the repeated Shane Company diamond commercials where causing me to bang my head into the dash board so often that it was creating a large dent.  But the Neos commercials were short, witty and appreciated.  However - this is the not the same Neos that you may be familiar with. This new Neos Medspa is under new ownership and management.  I was a little surprised with the small size of the new medspa, but I was also a little relieved.  I was always hesitant about certain procedures because you have to leave most of your modesty at the door and I am a rather modest person.  But the small staff (who are also the owners), and homely office, felt warming and welcoming.  It was definitely less intimidating than other medspas I have considered in the past.Neos was very honest and straightforward with me, they did not try to sell me any product or convince me I needed anything extra. I am easily influenced when it comes to buying things, so this is something appreciated more so by my husband.Since I have Sirius, I don't know if the new Neos Medspa has radio commercials or if they will have the same comical flair, but as long as Tom Shane is not involved, it won't be the most annoying thing on the radio.  If he is involved, I will be doing a review update.","product_id":"5","review_rating":3}

Most of the churches are so beautiful that it's such a great use of space.  This is no exception, as it's just so unique inside! If you're looking for that nontraditional hotel that's NOT a Marriott or Hilton, this is the place you'll want to stay!  It's fashioned like a European boutique hotel, plus all the amenities you'd be looking for like WiFi, a shuttle and continental breakfast (score!). It's also a really lovely place to have an event.  For smaller events you can rent out specific parlor's for a reasonable cost and you're able to bring in your own caterers.  I really like this option because you're not boxed into one choice that may be out of price range.  If I would have gotten married in Pittsburgh, this would  definitely have been my first choice for the reception.  The Grand Hall is just gorgeous!  It has the original church organ and stain glass windows.  When it's all dressed up for the event it's just a stunning place for a magical affair! The Northside of town, where it's located, has walkable access to the Andy Warhol Museum, The Mattress Factory Museum, The Children's Museum, The National Aviary, The Carnegie Science Center, PNC Park (home to the Pirates, go bucks!) and Heinz Field (home to the Stillerz, as we call them in the burgh).  Some are farther than others, but there's always the shuttle if it's in our frigid winter season.  In the summer, go for the walk so you can take in the sights!There's also a lot of cute restaurants and bars on East Ohio River Boulevard, which is two streets up from the hotel.  My suggestions would be Bistro to Go and Bistro Soul, Rita's Italian Ice (personal fave) or The Priory Bakery for dessert!  There's also Legends North Shore not far on E. North Ave. about two streets up from E. Ohio and Amani Coffee Shop and Cafe for a quick stop for coffee or a great panini for lunch.   It's really a fantastic time to go in the summer because EVERYTHING is within walking distance.  Plus they have a great farmers market in the park right along E. Ohio and they have kayaking in the park right by the Aviary.  The big kayaking organization, Venture Outdoors is right under the 6th St. Bridge next to PNC Park.  You're able to kayak around the three rivers for only $15 an hour!

Being that we're all married 30-something(some with kids) music fans, we don't always get a chance to get together and head out to a show.  But somehow the planets were aligned and the whole bunch went out to Moondog's for some great live music.This is another one of those places in which I can't believe I'm the first to review.  Moondog's is a local institution, people!  It's been around here ever since I can remember.  Rusted Root played here in their pre-\"Send Me On My Way\" days.It's everything you want in a small music venue.  Although does mean a slightly cramped seating area and the requisite long lines for the restrooms, it's a great intimate venue to see live music.  And Moondog's brings in the music!  It has everything from rock to blues to folk music.  The Starlite Lounge Restaurant is next door and you can order food from there and bring it into the club.  It's local music folks.  Come out and support it!","product_id":"9","review_rating":4}

I'm home for  the holidays right now and I just saw  Acoustic Syndicate, also a great show! Fantastic sound and a huge - and very accessable - bar. No smoking (or at least the night I was there), but there's a back area when smokers can go.

The first place I ever saw a concert in Charlotte and I was hooked.  The prices are standard bar, slightly overpriced with teeny tiny cups for mixed drinks.

The employees are very into the music as well, which is always a plus.  I hate going to really mainstream venues where the security and bartenders just blankly stare at the guests.  These guys are nodding along to the tunes and thoroughly feeling the grooves.  Someone told me that this place used to be a porn studio back in the 70's, this may be one of those city myths, but it looks like it could have been.  It would be pretty rock and roll if that were the case.  Anyways, I am a huge fan of the Visulite.","product_id":"8","review_rating":3}

It's not a big venue, but they get some decent acts for my music taste (JamFunkElectronica).Cover charges are usually around $10-15, extremely cheap (Obviously also depends on the artist....).  They also have both beer and liquor.  It's nice to have the option, some nights I just want to let it all out.  The beer selection is good as they have about 10-12 taps with local NC brews and the likes of Magic Hat, Sweetwater, New Belgium, etc.  They also have a good bottle selection for the stuff that's a little more rare.  Drinks are normal, reasonable prices.As far as the musiclayout is concerned, there really isn't a bad spot in the place.  It's multi-tiered, so lots of areas with a good view.  The barentrance is at the top, then it drops down to an open area with the sound board and cocktail tables (it's nice to have the option to sit and enjoy the music), and then drops down again to a pit area that's standing room only in front of the stage.  The stage is the height of the 2nd level with the cocktail tables, so that's usually where I'm at, but people are always getting down in the pit.  All in all, the layout of the place is why I like it so much.  The sound is great too.  You can't have a great music venue without great acoustics!  I always look forward to a show here.","product_id":"1","review_rating":4}

Pretty much all of the other music venues I wanted to visit reserve their acts for Friday and Saturday nights (especially on a holiday weekend like Thanksgiving). However, I'm more of a middle-of-the-week music appreciator. For other Monday night music lovers, this is an excellent place to take a visitor for some straight ahead jazz and blues. I used to love standing in line in the cold to see jazz played the way its meant to be played, in a smoky basement with singers and musicians jumping on the mic at completely unscheduled times, at a little club called Small's in Manhattan's West Village. And the ability to enjoy some of the best Rockabilly, Country, and Blues musicians around (for FREE!) at Rodeo Bar in Manhattan's Murray Hill any night of the week, has also spoiled me.My point being - places like Small's, Rodeo Bar, and Double Door Inn are a dying breed. It is your duty as a live music supporter to exercise your right to enjoy this craft in a setting that is up close and personal, and velvet-rope-free. Though I doubt that the Double Door can draw New York sized crowds on a \"school night\", if you bring a group of friends here now, it could quickly become your own private corner of musical heaven for years to come.","product_id":"2","review_rating":5}

Charlotte isn't known nationally for its music scene but with venues like this, it is hard to deny that you can't have a great time with Charlotte music. Decent beer selection and regular visits from the legendary Bill Hanna (at least legendary for Double Door Inn visitors) solidify the Inn as a location for musical bliss any night of the week.","product_id":"1","review_rating":5}

The Milestone is the perfect place to schmooze with the punks, metalheads and venueshow rats. Crawling with history, and plenty of stickers on every surface from showsbands of the past, this hole-in-the-wall turned landmark is one my favorite venues in the QC. I've been here on multiple occasions and each time has been different and more memorable than the last. My first impression, a while back, was a little disheartening from how many people were smoking inside. Now, so I hear, this has been done away with. Good for us non-smokers and maybe a blow to the cigarette-goers. However, this paled to the happiness I found in the small bar with cheap PBR and the even tinier stage. I've seen this stage packed with 6 member outfits with hardly enough room to play and smaller rockabilly bands tearing it up! So much personality there could be a novella written about the days it has seen. Goodness what a cool joint. This place isn't glamorous, folks. It's an old, converted house, turned-venue. If you're into punk, metal, or anything in between, check their website. Always booking shows and plenty of variety. You can buy tickets online or pay at the door. Beware on rainy nights. The parking lot, if you can call it a parking lot haha, gets really muddy. Park on the street to avoid a muddy car! Or, be awesome and park in the mud and make it a story!

No matter what you're interested in, if you want to have a drink the guys and girls here can help you find the perfect match for your palate. The wine selection is hard to beat, and you definitely won't find better deals anywhere else in Charlotte. The beer selection is also top notch, and they even do a yearly tasting outside with close to 100 beers to sample from.One of the best things about the Wine Vault, and something that really sets them apart from the other contenders in this genre, are their weekly tastings. For $5-10 (depending on the quality of the wines that week) you can taste up to 6 wines, and learn a little bit about each one while you do it. There's a large group of regulars who come to almost every tasting, so if you're new to the area it's also a great way to meet some really cool people. There's also an extensive wine cellar (hence the Vault name) downstairs with private bins that you can rent to store you own wine, in addition to a much larger seating area that I think most people don't even realize exists. They do lots of private events down in the main cellar room, so if you want to do a big corporate event like a private tasting it's a really cool atmosphere and something your friends or employees will remember for a long time.My favorite aspect though has to be the almost monthly wine dinners that the shop puts on in conjunction with some of the best restaurants in the Charlotte area. They are always extremely reasonable in price, especially when you compare it to similar offerings around town. Make sure you get on the mailing list, because you definitely want to sign up for these early before they get sold out!","product_id":"2","review_rating":5}

It's laid back atmosphere hits you from the parking lot, with acoustic sounds and the tinkling of laughter and wine glasses. At least a dozen tables spill outside the doors, filled with patrons and their cherished pets on any warm evening. It's commonplace to have live music from the patio, but doesn't overpower the conversations or keep the dogs from lounging. The ambiance, especially with the views of the lake and paddle boats, allows you to shift your mind into thinking you're anywhere but a local hangout in the Piedmont of NC. The Vault itself has tiny quarters, but stocks some well-treasured and fresh names, both in wine and brews. Snacks are available, with a varied assortment of cheeses, pretzels and party mix. It's very simple to walk in, make your selections, then take to the register for purchase. The only problem you may find are long lines, so I wouldn't wait until the last minute for a drink or the bathroom. It's worth a drive from anywhere in the Charlotte area to see what the UCB has been keeping to itself. This place is equally impressive for the intimate conversation of a first date, relaxing with a group of friends after work, or bringing your dog for some appreciative petting from strangers.

I came from way out of town for an act that I couldn't pass up: the Corb Lund Band.  Canadian Honky-Tonk at its finest!  What I like most was the vibes - this place has character.  You can tell the building is old, but from what it looks like, it is in great condition.  The mood lighting is red and dim and the decor has a 60s retro-modern twist.  I like it.  If it's open, try to grab a seat on the upstairs balcony, especially if seats are limited down below.  The view and sound is fantastic.Ticket prices are right on the mark - most shows that I saw are under $20, most well below that.  Corb was $15, and from the performance we got, I'd say it was well worth it.  What also blew me away was the drink prices, I got an above rail whiskey mixer for under $5.  Maybe I'm not used to small town prices, but this was an unexpected surprise.All towns would be so lucky to have a music venue like The Highdive.  I have to agree with Jess S. on her review; there are not many places like this in the Midwest, and surely not in Indy.  Keep booking the gigs, Highdive, I'll keep ordering Wild Turkey and Ginger Ales.","product_id":"10","review_rating":4}

For the Cowboy Nachos alone, which are a bed of chips topped with tomatoes, guacamole, white cheese sauce, jalapeno peppers, and cilantro chicken (optional), I would swim across the ocean to let this savory swell of heaven crash against my taste buds! The food here is excellent. Though it is on the pricey side, when the patio and kitchen are open during the warm months, it is worth celebrating. Sadly, Cowboy Monkey does not serve their tasty Tex-Mex fare during winter or early spring. They open just in time for EbertFest at the end of April. If you like Americanized Mexican food, do yourself a favor and check this place out.","product_id":"1","review_rating":3}

Coming from Boston, I yearn to have some kind of architectural history, buildings that have meaning, purpose,  character. I mean how many adobe style, clay shingled buildings can we have seriously So if your looking for cool atmosphere, a safe venue (well lite parking lots) and great music, check out the brick house. I saw Okkerivil River here, and the experience was great, and the venue is the perfect size for a small show. They serve a wide range of beer and drinks. (food too) My only complaint, it was pretty hot inside, but then again it's ALWAYS hot inside buildings here in September.

You can get meat, vegetarian or a combo of both (which is always what I ended up with). Delish salad to accompany and bread to take those last swipes of sauce off your plate.

Well, Mr. Waiter kindly informed me that their sandwiches are pre-made and they are unable to alter them in any way.  Hmm...pre-made hot sandwiches that are deliciously devine  I'm a skeptic.  After asking around, I found an inside source that said that their sandwiches are NOT pre-made but the managerschefs say that so that they don't get overwhelmed with nit-picky custom orders by my fellow corporate cube monkeys during the lunch rush.  My point:  the next time you want your Cubano with no mustard or extra sauce, don't believe the hype and make them customize it for you!

I still feel a bit guilty, as I've been with Eliana's for years, but when Guanaquito does it better in almost every way, how can you fault me If you blink, you'll miss it- on McDowell, between the Gourmet House of Hong Kong and Arizona Endoscopy Services. You need to park in back, accessible from a driveway before you pass by the dully colored sign for Guanaquito.Like Eliana's, it's Salvadoran cuisine, but there are so many more options at Guanaquito. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and based on tonight's sampling, Hubby and I will be back often to work our way through the menu. I had the ensalada drink and Hubby had the Horchata, which the waitress patiently explained was different from Mexican Horchata. It sure was- maybe it was the morrow seed that made it so unique. For his entree, Hubby had the equivalent of the sampler platter- a tamale (again, quite different from a Mexican tamale- softer and creamier), 2 pastales (meat pies) and 2 pupusas (stuffed, grilled tortillas). Guanaquito had a far greater variety of pupusas than Elaina's, and they were every bit as good. The one that I had that was most unique was made with cheese and loroco plant (which to me had an asparagus-y taste). Definitely delicious. At both Salvadoran places, we were served a bowl of cabbage salad, but at Eliana's we had never been told how to eat it. Guanaquito's was far less astringent and we were instructed to eat it with our pupusas. I was skeptical at first, but became quickly hooked. It did not overwhelm the taste of the pupusas, and added a nice crunch and zing. The only thing I found that Eliana's did better than Guanaquito was the flan. Guanaquito's texture was off, but the flavor was acceptable.I suppose I'm willing to share my new love with all of you- but be forewarned- she's a saucy mistress you'll be compelled to visit again and again. Oh- and she's cheap, too. Hubby and I got out of there for $24 (and that includes the extras I got to round out my leftovers for lunch tomorrow!).","product_id":"1","review_rating":3}

Huge chunks of carrot, potato, and zucchini, with some thin noodles, and a savory broth with some mint leaves. I quickly abandoned the rest of my entree in favor of finishing the huge bowl of magic. It was the best soup I've had since coming to Phoenix 13 years ago. Good thing Hubby got sick this weekend- it gave me an excuse to go back and get some more. Being magical, you know it has serious healing properties. Here's where I learned that the Sopa de Gallina is chicken soup without the chicken meat and the Sopa de Pollo is the same thing but with the meat. Two huge Styrofoam cups to go with lemon wedges and 4 hot and fresh tortillas cost less than $6.00. I was stunned. The owner said it costs more with meat. Believe me, you won't miss it.

I'm a fan of the chicken soup you get, but just wish the serving size was slightly bigger.The appetizer comes with 3 different items and all are equally tastey (ref. pupusa). They also give you some cabbage salad and a tomato sauce to accompany the items, yum.My gf ordered the recommended chicken dish and lurved the hell out of it, I agreed and actually was wishing I'd gotten that instead of the Salvadorian marinated steak, which was good, but paled in comparison to the chicken.Sidenotes: Try the ensalada drink, it's a sweet fruit based drink that comes with slices of apple. Sort of reminds me of drinking a melted otter pop, which as far as I'm concerned is off the proverbial chain. Also served with appetiser and as a sidedish with the food was a bean soup which was good and great for dipping the tortillas in.

It's the best little hole-in-a-rundown-strip-mall you can find. And it's cheap!Nestled between stores like Big Lots and some electronic place with Mexican ranchero music blasting, this tiny place is hidden in the corner. The owner is from El Salvador, so don't expect it to be Mexican food -- there are many similarities, but the dishes themselves are different.Walking in, you can smell the homemade pupusas -- seriously, it smells like the roadside stands along the bus routes in central America. It's amazing. There are only a couple waitresses, and I don't think they speak much English, but the menu is in pictures, as well as in Spanish and some English, so you should do just fine.Get the pupusas - they're like thick, hand-made tortillas stuffed with either pork, cheese and beans or, my favorite, cheese and loraco flower, which is some green and edible plant that tastes a bit like asparagus, to me. It's definitely the best one. These things come with salsa and some coleslaw (if they don't, just ask for the salsa) and are very filling!The other dishes are really good, too. For a low price, you can get an entire plate of things like meat with rice and beans - and this place doesn't skimp on the fixin's. They put slices of fresh tomatoes, avocado and all kinds of other stuff on the plates.I honestly LOVE it here.

I must say I'm not a big fan of the tamales, they are too moist for my taste. The banana leaves do give a great flavor though. The true stars are the pupusas, which I had never had before and have since become addicted too. I literally order at least 6 for myself every time I go now. They are asininely delicious!!! I grab a large bite of pupusa and some of the curtido (a kind of slaw-ish awesomeness) and just chow down. Beware the post-lunch coma though as eating that many will knock the average person on their ass. This brings me to my one bone to pick with this stripmall gem, their coffee sucks! I was expecting super-strong coffee with mud at the bottom when I ordered the cafe listo but it tasted like gas station coffee. They didn't even have any milk, just powdered non-dairy nonsense...I'm already a diehard fan but if they stepped up the coffee I would pretty much call it my mecca. This is the kind of food that makes all seem right with the world...Holy Shit!!! I almost forgot about the ceviche! It's a little pricey but it is soooo worth it. I split it with one of my people at work and ended up sharing it with the whole office......very much against my will. People thought it looked so good they just kept poaching forkfulls off my plate. Definietly a must have dish","product_id":"4","review_rating":3}

I just moved back to the valley after 6yrs away, having discovered and fallen in love with El Salvadorian food in the mean while. I was worried that I wouldn't find a good spot here as we some times lack in fine ethnic cuisine that isn't Mexican. I was tickled pink last night to discover Salvadoreno in an unassuming strip mall in Mesa (they have 2 other locations around the valley). The food was blissfully authentic as was the price. They even suggested a deal on the menu for 20 pupusas for $30. I might add this place to my bi-weekly grocery shopping list. I can't say enough about how happy I was to get real El Salvadorian food that hadn't been taken over by the flavors of Mexico, U.S. or Arizona. One of the family members who runs the joints was even there and everyone who worked there was quite friendly. I'm happy to support these guys. I will definitely be returning.","product_id":"6","review_rating":3}

The moment I walked in, I was reminded of my my aunty's old restaurant shop. I do mean to say \"restaurant shop\" because that's exactly what it is. a restaurant and shelves of snacks, toys and other take-home things. I guess that's one reason why I love this place, for taking me back to a childhood I almost forgot.I've never been to any other columbian eatery, but word is that the portions are huge. Which they were.. for me and my sister anyway. We shared this plate of \"Tamal\" which came with a side of rice. By the way, the rice was surprisingly sweet. Almost like sticky rice. It really complimented the spices in the tamal. I've also discovered the best made empanadas ever! probably even better than filipino empanadas =X. It's unique for it's crispy crust and its pasty potato & beef mix inside. And what set it in stone for me was the ajiahjiahhee (oh whatever the spelling is) sauce.That place brought together family. Mainly because we realized we were sitting next to the family of my sisters friend. They also have a huge extended area. Cus the area we were in was the \"restaurant shop\" But the other side is specifically restaurant. It's good for big groups and such. Cus yeah, I'm all about rolling deep!

Not oily, or too much masa and not enough filling. The curtido here is always crunchy and delicious. Never too salty or vinegary. I also love the variety of fillings they have at this location for pupusas. Chicharrones and cheese is one my favorites but the calabasas and cheese is definitely in my rotation now. I recently had the yucca and fried chicharrone and while it was not as delicious as my pupusas, it was good. The fried pork was definitely fried as it was super crispy and once I added some salt and tomato sauce it was good eats. The yucca was perfect. Soft and creamy on the inside and a nice bite on the outside.Helpful Hint: Call your order in ahead of time if you don't want to wait long for your food.

I never wanted it shorter than shoulder length, but decided recently to make a change. Because I'm getting older, and other methods of increasing the volume and amount of my hair were too expensive, or didn't work,  I wanted to try a shorter cut. The cut she gave me made my hair look much thicker. I have had several compliments on the cut, one from another hairstylist who worked at Regis. Sue is also reasonable, charging $80 for my cut and hi-lights. I will admit that I had to wait outside the salon once when I was the first customer of the day, but that was once in over 5 years.

{"review_title":"On my recent road trip from Dallas to New Haven, CT, Randy...","review_body":"On my recent road trip from Dallas to New Haven, CT, Randy S. and I stopped in Pittsburgh to revel in its charms. This, I must add, was in opposition to his mother's strong protests to the effect of, \"There's nothing *in* Pittsburgh, why would anyone go there\" Tazza D'oro is the answer to that question. Especially if you like coffee. This is easily one of the best coffee shops east of the Mississippi, and I've been to a lot of them. So, what's so good about itLet's go in order of importance:Coffee - It is really, really good. They use Batdorf and Bronson beans, where an ex-gf of mine used to work in Olympia. Believe me when I tell you that B&B is good. It's not amazingly great, but it's very solid and they take roasting seriously. When I go to a new coffee place I suspect might be good I always get a latte. Why This one has a high upside if done well and the lowest downside (lots of milk) if done poorly. I got a latte. They have a few sizes, 12oz was the first one I got. It was fantastic. They did a nice little rosetta in it too (look up latte art on google if you have no idea what this is). The baristo really knew what he was doing and pulled a some good shots with excellent crema. The coffee was so good (coffee is supposed to taste bold, smooth and rich, which it almost never does and this place had it down) I had to go back for an 8oz, which is another level of trust. It has the same amount of coffee but less milk to hide poor coffee quality. It was always superior. This is a coffee place that is truly top notch based on the coffee alone, but there was more. Pastries - They all looked amazing. I had a plain donut while I waited in line. Normally I don't eat plain donuts, because life is too short for plain donuts, but it was really, very good. Everyone was commenting on how nice the pastries were.Atmosphere - This place has it exactly right. It's a mom & pop feel, nothing forced. Some tables, outdoor seating, maybe some local art, but not in a goofy sort of way. Very friendly employees. Just a complete home run. Obviously I loved it. Behind me in line for my re-up, I heard a girl behind me in line complain, \"we could just go to Starbucks, it's cheaper!\" then proceeded to order with sugar free syrups and skim milk. That's fine. Everyone has to do what they like... and with the proliferation of bad coffee (Starbucks only being guilty of mediocre, though a little bit interesting coffee) over the past 10 years, I don't blame people for being set that way. But the beautiful thing about Tazza D'Oro (cup of gold in Italian) is that--if you let it--it will remind you that you don't need to make your coffee up like a drag queen on Halloween.Tazza D'Oro stands as a reminder that coffee can be enjoyed in all its naked glory in an awesome setting on a beautiful street and give you a good f'ing reason to go to Pittsburgh.","product_id":"4","review_rating":4}
{"review_title":"This is one of my two favorite coffeehouses in town. It...","review_body":"This is one of my two favorite coffeehouses in town. It took me far too long to come around and love Tazza D'oro. A horrible ex of mine loved this place and I admit that this soured me. I regret the time I wasted not going here. The dark wood inside comforts me. The small tables outside are a great place to spend the summer. Tazza D'Oro brews Batdorf and Bronson beans (amazing), provides Enrico pastries (amazing) free wireless (amazing) and one of the most talented and friendly staffs I've ever met (amazing). Everyone who works there is *so* nice and *so* good at what they do. They have a small menu of localfresh food that looks amazing, but I have never actually eaten it. The espresso served here is actually better than the average shot served at Batdorf and Bronson locations in Olympia, WA. I talked about this with one of the barristas at TD'o and they were offended - \"we calibrate our machines the same, we use the same beans, the exact same blends and milks and everything, it can't be different.\" Sorry, Tazza D'oro, you are better. The lines get long on weekend mornings, but they move quickly. There's a sense of community nestled here, just off the \"main drag\" of Highland Park, between Bryant st. and the reservoir. This is where you can pick up your CSA shipment for the week, where multiple weekly bike rides originate, where there are lively discussion groups meeting nearly every day. The percentage of students is low. Like the rest of Pittsburgh, there's a good chance you'll run into someone you know, but generally I see people I like and miss, which is different than the norm in Pittsburgh for me.","product_id":"8","review_rating":3}

The espresso is, bar none, the best I've had - including my admittedly limited travels in Italy. It's stellar espresso - rich, thick, potent without being sour or bitter, with unique nuances that vary slightly depending on the shot and the weather, but are always fantastic.The coffee is also terrific, and Tazza D'Oro uses Batdorf & Bronson beans - the best I've ever had for home grinding. They have a good selection of pastries and cookies, as well as a broad selection of tasty sandwiches that come with a satisfying side salad.In addition, they have a wonderful selection of teas; I'm no expert, and don't know their supplier, but the half-dozen different blends I've tried were all memorably flavorful.All that, and it's a lovely center of community, where you can bring your laptop or a book or a friend and spend the day. No one is rushed out the door, and there almost always seems to be a little room for your studies or conversation.","product_id":"9","review_rating":3}

Granted, Quiet Storm like many Pittsburgh places doesn't have an alcohol license and has to make do.  Ginger lemonade  Yes.  All these other things from the soda fountain that are adult like enough for me  Yeah!I do love my meat, but found the vegan food here pretty good (albeit dry but I attribute that to my love of meaty things).  They used to have a prixe fixe meal on the weekends, but I think they got rid of that due to a low turnout.  Too bad most of Pittsburgh doesn't really learn to love culture.Usually good music acts here.  Although the few times I was here, there was barely anybody else there besides the group I dragged along and the band's friends.  Usually 2-3 acts play.  Live.  And it's nice that there aren't many of us because we can sit up close.  And be sure to kick the friend who thinks it's ok to talk over the music.  The bathroom also has a decor to match the style of the coffeehouse.I have never been here during the daytime so I can't comment on that.  Always great service when we came here for dinner and the music (since we were basically the only ones there).  Sometimes a minimal cover for the music.

Those two facts have nothing to do with each other--the period in question was close to the end of the first semester of my (super-)senior year, when my friends and I would stay in our studios all night working, haul ass out to Quiet Storm for ambrosia-caliber restorative tofu scramble and coffee, and go back to school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for another day of class.  And then usually I'd take a three-hour nap after the first class.  But I'm sorry, what is it I'm reviewing hereThe Quiet Storm has absolutely the best tofu scramble I've ever had.  I'm an accomplished vegan eater (I get stuff in my mouth first try nine times out of ten), I've had the best scrambles New York and San Francisco have to offer.  Believe you me, Quiet Storm tops them all.  I wish I knew their secret recipe, but the part I do know--baking the tofu rather than just sauteeing it--makes a tremendous difference.  Come in on a lazy Sunday morning, get the Nothin' Fancy, and you will see for yourself just how good tofu can be.  On top of that, they are as vegan-friendly as can be, with earth balance for the toast; soy, rice, and almond milks; and a selection of specifically vegan mixed drinks and milkshakes.  Plus, sandwiches!  Get the spicy spinach and peanut butter wrap, ask for added tofu (planks not crumble), and be astonished yet again.AND AND, as a delicious cherry on top, they have theme brunches, fantastic theme brunches that show off the creativity and chops of the cooks here in a way that the regular menu can only hint at.  Check out their website and see when the next theme brunch is, and make a point of going.  Get there early.","product_id":"1","review_rating":5}

It's a pain for the car less (me) to get to, and the service is fairly lacking, it's cash only with no convenient ATM's around, the closest business is a McDonald's half a mile away. And I still go there every chance I get. Hipsters abound (pro or con, depending on who you are) and the place is REALLY child friendly (again, could be a pro or con). But generally, the crowd is mellow, reading, chatting, just enjoying.The menu is designed in a way that they have something for everyone (except those adverse to eating healthy :). Between the veg and vegan options, they manage to have a menu that is fairly celiac friendly too, not an easy thing to do!A lot of the reviews here are about breakfast, which is amazing. But my favorite are their dinner salads. They're protein heavy, with a huge variety of ingredients, not your typical salads. And their specials, like tofu curry, are amazing, and always enough food for two.Oh, and the drink menu! I'm pretty much a water, coffee, beer kind of person, so I haven't tried too much on it.

Before visiting the Quiet Storm I didn't realize that their entire menu was vegetarian, but that shouldn't be much of a problem even for fans of meat. I ordered the \"Maelstrom\" which is a what I would call a Mediterranean Quesadilla. The flavor was subtle, but delicious. There were plenty of menu options and it looks like this restaurant is really doing it's part to support the local community. The only complaint I would have was that the temperature also got a bit cold as we were sitting by the door... and it was winter. Finally, remember to bring enough cash to cover the bill as that's the only way to pay.

I went here for the first time last night and wasn't sure what to expect when i walked in.  The place seems to have some spacial issues.  There was a bar but they don't serve alcohol, more of a coffeediner bar.  The tables and chairs seem odd and it took me a while to find a chair that was comfortable, but maybe this is by design.  I am not a coffee expert but i really enjoyed my several cups of decaf.  Anyhoo, to the food.  This place is vegetarian only.   I started with a Hummus plate, unlike most creamy hummuses this hummus was gritty as i could actually taste the chick peas with each bite.  The hummus was surrounded by fresh crisp cucumbers, carrots, celery, calamata olives (big fan) and pita. Perfect starter.  For my main entree i ordered the curry special.  Do not expect an Indian food experience but this will not disappoint.   Everything was in the bowl, chick peas, basmanti rice, carrots, and other miscellaneous items.  Once i started dipping my pita into it I could not stop.  It was savory, spicy and just the perfect compliment to the cold snowy night.    This is one storm i will enjoy braving from time to time.","product_id":"4","review_rating":4}

It's a little out of the way, but once we got there, it's exactly the kind of place I want to live close to. It's spacious and relaxed; we sat there for two hours after eating our lunch and were not at all pressured to move on. It had a very good neighborhood vibe, and everyone working there knew the place and the area really well.The drink options were pretty great- the coffee was just fine, but the ginger lemonade I ordered a couple hours after lunch was phenomenal. I wish I could have that more often. The food was great; there are lots of options and the portion sizes were exactly what I wanted. I had the Dagwood sandwich, which was a perfect mix of sweet, sour, and spicy with hummus, apples, hot peppers, cucumbers, and pickles... it came with an option of the side, and I had to try the mockamole. A big fan of guacamole myself, I was totally in doubt of a green pea-based mock version. I also really like peas, though, so I was open. And somehow they managed to make it work, and it really did taste very much like guac, with a slightly less heavy and maybe a bit grainier texture. But definitely worth a try. My friend had a wrap with curry and tofu and I honestly don't remember what else, but it was huge and really tasty. She chose the potato salad as her side, and it was the perfect imitation of German potato salad, so I was pretty happy. All in all, if you're in Pittsburgh and feel a little lost... go to Zenith and Quiet Storm, and you will feel found.","product_id":"2","review_rating":3}

The food: The menu was quite extensive...hoagies, soups, pasta, salads, etc. They also have stuff for kids like grilled cheese.

Did I mention this also came with soup I paid $13 total for my meal and a cold chai. Could not ask for more.

One  thing that makes their coffee so good is that they roast them on the premises.  You can really taste the difference versus getting bulk coffee at Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts.  Some of my favorite blends include the Ethiopian Harrar, Costa Rican Tarrazu, and if in the mood for something a little stronger and darker, I recommend the French Roast.  They have their private blends too.I'm not into tea as much, although I'll buy here in the summer to make ice tea.

They had fancy lattes with turtle, chocolate, raspberry, etc enticing names. I decided to stick with one of their brews for the day: Southern Pecan roast and had it just black. It was quite delicious. My sister just asked for a large coffee on ice. I'm not sure which roast she ended up with but the flavor was gone after she drenched it with milk and nasty saccharine.

In front of me in line were a group of people discussing the merits of Lambrusco wine from Modena and how its \"Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita\" certification is reason enough not to confuse it with lesser imports marketed under the same name.  Mind you, this conversation was entirely in Italian.  Meanwhile, behind me there were some old men have an entirely different conversation in Italian.  This was by no means unique to my first visit either.  It really is a slice of Italy here!Authentic ambiance aside, the coffee is rather good too.

Espresso  They are actually one of the wholesalers for espresso machines in the city, and they actually service the machines.  Yeah, they know what they're doing.  You really can't miss at all here.  The best part though is that this is genuinely a place where you want to hang out, relax, and socialize.  It's wonderful!","product_id":"2","review_rating":3}

La Prima Espresso Company has actually broken me out of this habit. I went back here several times over a 3 day period during my visit in Pittsburgh. We stumbled across this cute Italian coffee shop on our way to watch the runners at the Pittsburgh Marathon. I needed coffee and I needed it now. This was the first place I saw.  To my amazement, the coffee was probably some of the best I've had. I kid you not.  I did not have to put anything in it (I did add some cinnamon though).  It is fantastic!  Perfectly brewed to perfection.  I even bought a bag of beans of La Prima's own Grow Pittsburgh brand bold flavor that they have made locally. It's delicious!This is a really authentic Italian coffee shop attached to a bakery and a wonderful find right off \"The Strip\" in Downtown Pittsburgh.","product_id":"1","review_rating":3}

I mean, McDonald's and Dunkin Donuts make some reasonably tasty coffee at very affordable prices.  I've never been a fan of Starbucks, too bitter and expensive.  But when I can I will frequent local coffee shops looking for something amazing.  Well La Prima is that something amazing.I first encountered their coffee at Coca Cafe.  I don't usually taste coffee and say, \"Wow, that coffee is really good!\"  But on the occasion where I first tasted La Prima, that's exactly what I said.  That was months ago and I don't know why it took me so long to make it down to their shop in the Strip.  Perhaps because it is the summer and one of the last things on my mind during this time is hot beverages.  Now every time I brew some of those fresh beans, I feel like I'm treating myself and I enjoy the taste of just the coffee without adding sugar andor cream. It's a very welcoming place if not a bit overwhelming with all the choices.  But if you're in the Strip and looking for a good cup of coffee, La Prima Espresso Company is highly recommended!","product_id":"10","review_rating":4}

And without knowing what egg cream (chocolate) is, my friend ordered it out of curiosity. We were told that it was made out of sparkling water (they use san pellegrino I believe as they also sell that as bottled drinks), chocolate syrup and foamed milk. It was served on ice. I have never had the combination of milk and sparkling water and it is surprisingly good! Good option for non-coffee drinkers.The best part It is 2 doors down from a popcorn store(which is also a local favorite too, expect lines out the door). We ended up sitting outside enjoying coffee and popcorn for the rest of the afternoon.","product_id":"7","review_rating":5}

I have NO green thumb WHATSOEVER, but had passed by for about a year now since I moved to Dormont and had always thought the shop looked cute. Now was my chance as I needed a last minute Christmas present for my grandma. The place is larger than you think from the outside. They actually have a whole outdoor area that's covered for the winter with many different plants I couldn't identify. I thought the owner was super duper sweet and just really energetic. Her and another staff member helped me pick out a plant that was in a vase, not in a pot, and looked really cool and modern. I loved it and had a fleeting thought to pick one up myself... if I wouldn't kill it (which I probably would!). I had commented about a table full of vases filled with what looked like works of art. They turned out to be flower displays for hotels, but man where they cool. If I was doing an event or having a wedding, that's exactly what I would have wanted. They just looked really modern but creative. They also have some winged friends you can say hi to, including one screaming one in the back that you can't see. Kinda creepy, but I guess that comes with a unique shop! I will absolutely be back to pick up items for people and consider them for any events I have coming up.","product_id":"6","review_rating":3}

It was a good move. The flowers arrived on time and according to my mother-in-law the arrangement was spectacular and the flowers were so fresh that she was sure they'd keep for a good while. I also was happy that Ludwig's didn't gouge me on all of those extra fees that usually get tacked on at check-out by the big companies. My advice from now on is to go local whenever you can.

I told him the two flowers that were her favorite and said that they needed to be used, but to do what ever else he thought would make the flowers beautiful.  I gave him the amount I wanted to spend and left it all up to him.  Absolutely wonderful customer service!

I could have eaten just the antipasti alone as a full meal; the standout was a baked pumpkin full of gruyere, herbs and croutons... delicious.  For dinner, we had butternut squash soup with gorganzola and pecans, homemade pasta with a pistachio cream sauce, veal chops and an italian vegetable medely that was perfect with everything else.  Tiramisu for desert.  Everything that came out was delicious and perfectly prepared - plus Maria was standing right there in the kitchen to answer any questions we had about the food or cooking in general.  Wine was BYOB, and I think we went through ~10 bottles.  No corkage fees...This is an amazing dinner for those who have patience.

Pies, breads and of course the best biscotti around! Though, the true treasure exists in the upstairs apartment where Maria has cooking classes and serves a 6 course meal to parties of  8-10 most nights of the week. I heard about the private parties while at a food tour of Bloomfield. I knew I needed to get a reservation but, I had no idea how difficult that task would be. We scheduled a dinner in October for the first available Friday or Saturday which was 6 months later! That's right folks, 6 months in advance! The menu changes seasonally and is posted on the website. We ordered earlier in the week so that Maria had time to purchase the necessary items and prepare our meal. The menu would typically be the same for all 8 in the party but, Maria graciously offered to allow us to split the entrees into a meat and a non meat option to allow those who don't eat meat on Fridays during lent to have another option. When we arrived, we all enjoyed the appetizers in a sitting room at the front of the apartment. The appetizers themselves were a meal- meatballs, bread, shrimp, spinach pie, stuffed tomatoes and cheese with roasted peppers- all of which were incredible. Bring along your wine as Merante's is BYOB. The next course was soup which we were served in the formal dinning room which opened to the small kitchen where Maria cooks your meal. At first it was a little awkward sitting so close to the kitchen and Maria. Imagine having dinner at your grandmother's home with 7  of your closest friends. But, Maria did a great job of giving us our privacy. We hardly even noticed that she was there. After the soup came the pasta (homemade gnocchi anyone), then the entrees and vegetables, then the salad and last, the dessert. This was a meal fit for a king! The portions were huge! Luckily, Maria boxed up the leftovers making for an easy lunch the next day. If your lucky, you may even get to take home a little extra something such as extra sauce or a homemade truffle. Absolutely everything about this dinner was perfection. Everything (from the food to the service and hospitality) was done with the utmost care and concern to ensure a wonderful experience. I would literally come here every month if it were possible. Unfortunately, Maria is booked through the end of 2014! Not one day available in the next 8 months!

PICT, as the name implies performs pieces of Irish and classical theatre seasonally at the theaters of the University of Pittsburgh in the Stephen Foster Memorial (attached to the Cathedral of Learning).

It makes me so proud to see the talent in this city whenever I attend one of their shows. I guarantee you that if you check back each season you'll find at least one show to enjoy. Every year their line-up changes and it always features an incredible variety of shows. I've seen a classics such as \"Antony and Cleopatra\" to the interesting (but potentially uncomfortable) \"In the Next Room (or The Vibrator Play).\" My outright favorite evening with PICT was during a premiere of a play named \"Our Class,\" which was an incredibly shocking but important play about, sadly, real events: a WWII mass murder of the Jewish community living in a town in Poland. No one wanted to speak during or after that show, and the actors handled the roles and portrayal of both inhumane actions and traumatic events incredibly and impressively well. Kudos to them and all of PICT for tackling such an imposing but important project.I have plans to see at least one more if not two more PICT performances this year; not once have they disappointed me, and their contributions to the theater scene in this city are always outstanding. Thank you, PICT!","product_id":"1","review_rating":4}

I have also attended the opera in other cities, most notably New York City and Sidney, and I feel that we are very lucky to have such an excellent company in Pittsburgh.  The season usually provides lots of variety, and the artistic standards are very high.  The Benedum itself is a magnificent venue to attend an opera, they have done a wonderful job restoring this historic building.  The acoustics of the Benedum are also really excellent.  The super titles are easy to read from just about any seat.  The orchestra is well rehearsed and play beautifully.  I also think that most people have  misconceptions about opera which can be easily be proved wrong by visiting the Pittsburgh Opera.","product_id":"1","review_rating":4}

It's one of my favorite venue's to see a show because it's a whole experience.  There's not a bad seat in the house because it only holds about 200 tables.  Plus they have VIP seating in the front, which provides you with some comfy sofa's to sit on.I'm very excited to see a new caterer come in since the companion restaurant closed next door.  I wasn't too thrilled with the food selections...I really don't know how you make Pizza bad...but they somehow did.  I loved The Big Bang and I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change.  They honestly do a fantastic job casting the shows.  I have my own personal favorites, it's my own personal fan club of one!Keep in mind there's discounts if you work for certain corporations, you're a student or you come a in group.  Everyone loves a discount!  Go see something so you can stop singing the same Cabaret lyrics over and over again every time you think of the place!","product_id":"2","review_rating":3}

I can honestly say that my wife and I had a blast. We thoroughly enjoyed the topic, the performer, the view from our seats, and the food was very simple and tasty.

I love live theater and the CLO offers a fun and unique alternative way to enjoy that experience.  The seating is set up in such a way that there is not a bad seat in the house.  Along the sides you are seated in high bar tables, the middle section is typical table seating and the back of the house is raised on a platform to allow for easier viewing.Most of the shows at CLO are small ensemble casts or only one or two actors.  The way the room is set up, you feel like you know them by the end of the show.  The quality of the productions is fantastic.  I've seen both plays and musicals and the acting, staging and sets have been great for both.  It is amazing what can be done through simple stage sets and props to bring the show to life.  The only down side is that drinks are on the pricey side ($8-9 for a class of wine, $10+ for a mixed drink).  However, you are paying for the convenience of drinking while enjoying a show and the drink prices are pretty comparable to some of the other bars in the cultural district.  I look forward to my next visit to CLO.","product_id":"6","review_rating":4}

We had to wait a while to get a drink, but there were a lot of people there all at once, so that is bound to happen.The ushers and other staff were all very polite.

This unique theater adds so much to the mix!  It's a fantastic theater because they focus on plays, usually with one musical in the mix. There's new works here, like the original show The Chief, about what else, but Pittsburgh Steelers founding owner Art Rooney.  They bring in the classics like A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Important of Being Earnest.  They also have newer works right off Broadway, like The Rabbit Hole and Superior Donuts.  Plus, they bring in Second City every year, which is big in my book because they've spawned a couple SNL cast members!! I absolutely LOVE the theater!  I'm a big fan of a theater in the round.  That means there's seating on 3 sides of the stage.  They've also been able to do some really cool things with the stageset, like making an actual pool for the show Metamorphoses.  My favorite all time show was The Secret Letters of Jackie and Marilyn, which was a world premiere.  The show was about a made up relationship between the two women where they wrote letters to each other.  It was a VERY cool concept! They also do a lot of great events like the Mix at 6 for young professionals before a show.  Plus, they understand that most of us under 26 (and of course sometimes above) are broke ho's, they offer $15 tickets!  The great thing is, there's really not a bad seat in the house! Again, we have a fantastic theater district, so TAKE ADVANTAGE and go here!  Don't make me tell you twice!!","product_id":"5","review_rating":5}

(i.e. be careful with children)I went to see Electra thanks to Yelp's Culture Month.  The tickets were half price!  Can't be that!  We were 6 minutes late, oops, but the box office was still able to give us our will call tickets and we were lead to watch the performance on a monitor until we could be taken inside.  We were lead inside with 3 other couples while the show was going on.  The only drawback was that we kind of had to just sit wherever (instead of our assigned seats) so as to not make much ruckus.All in all, FANTASTIC performance, and lovely theater.","product_id":"7","review_rating":3}

{"review_title":"This is by far and away my favorite theater in Pittsburgh!...","review_body":"This is by far and away my favorite theater in Pittsburgh! If you've ever been here you KNOW how beautiful it is! It's a historic landmark and was built in 1927 and restored in the 80's to it's original state. It holds around 2,200 seats and is the third largest stage in the country. As you can see, I'm a total nerd about this theater.So let me give you some BIG insider tips about seating! Avoid at all costs the outer sides of the Left and Right Orchestra (the floor) in the front. You can actually get a cheap seat if you sit in the back of the Left and Right sides but only sit on the aisle. IF an aisle seat isn't available, go for First or Second Tier. I would rather see the show from far away than half see the show! The touring Broadway, Pittsburgh CLO, Pittsburgh Opera and Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre perform here. So go support our local theater! Just remember it's right here in the burgh, it's still a fantastic production and it's cheaper than a trip to NYC!","product_id":"3","review_rating":4}

I decided to book tickets for the Dracula Saturday Matinee so that we could have a night out on the town after the show. This theater is really exquisite! Prepare to go back in time to the decadence of the 1920's.Marble, sconces, crystal chandeliers, staircases, and brass railings adorn the beautiful space. Take some time after the performance to tour the interior rooms!The ballet was immensely enjoyable in it's own right. The back drops dark, sinister, and ethereal all at the same time. The dancers floating gracefully around the stage as if their feet fluttered just above the ground. Classical music flowed into the hall and moved with the performers during the most intense scenes. It was so romantic. I can't wait to go again!Pricing is quite reasonable too. You can go for the cheap seats for $20 on the top tier left or right of the center. $50 for better seating towards the center or orchestra seating for $90 being the best seat in the house. I love that on the website you can choose your own seats. Parking can be found two blocks away for $5 at the parking garage.

{"review_title":"The Benedum Center for the Performing Arts was originally a...","review_body":"The Benedum Center for the Performing Arts was originally a movie theater called The Stanley. It was built in 1927 and was billed as \"Pittsburgh's Palace of Amusement.\" It's acoustics are nearly perfect because back when it was built, 65 cents would not only buy you a \"photoplay\", but you'd also get live entertainment too. A two year renovation in the late 1980s under the guidelines of the U.S. Department of the Interior brought it back to its original condition. The grand lobby's mirrors and woodwork are all original. Of the more than 90 chandeliers and sconces in the theater, only one is a replica. In fact, the main chandelier weighs 4,700 pounds and is 20 feet high and 12 feet wide. The sightlines here are awesome. It truly is a masterpiece of theater design. Let's face it fellow Yelpers, you're not here for my architectural reviews are you Okay. I came here last night for the Decemberists concert featuring Justin Townes Earle as the opener. There were only single seats left when I tried to get tickets. So I ended up going by myself to the show. Hey a married babe can treat herself to a night out on occasion! The Portland, OR based Decemberists have been burning up the indie rock scene for a few years now and their CD \"The King Is Dead\" has been doing quite well. So much so that it reached 1 on the Billboard Charts in late January. The Decemberists in the past have dabbled in so-called \"progressive rock\" and British folk but this new CD is definitely more of an AmericanaAlt Country sound. So much so that the single \"Down by the Water\" reminds me of Firetown's \"The Good Life\" for some reason (Firetown later evolved into Garbage--in both senses of the word.. But that's another story). So it was no surprise that after doing \"The Crane Wife, Parts 1-3\", Colin Meloy told the audience \"I don't know who wrote the set list, but they thought we were a prog band. We're not a prog band anymore. We're a folk band.\" Hmmm! That actually was a pretty apt description. Despite this, they managed to get a lot of songs in from their catalogue. There was plenty of good singin' and good playin' though. Sam Watkins of Nickel Creek played fiddle against Jenny Conlee's accordion and they did a rousing Irish jig to the song \"Rox in the Box\". It was almost strange though how Meloy apologized for taking the tempo down a notch during the gorgeous new song \"Rise to Me\". They also did their most epic pieces in the middle of the show, and face it folks, you can't keep a good prog band down! But anyway, this show proved that the Decemberists aren't some flash in the pan. Their many musical stylings and their abililty to move a show along proves that they're in it for the long haul. I should also mention that my 60-something father, a music fan in his own right, absolutely loves the Decemberists. Now you know where I get those genes from. As I mentioned, Justin Townes Earle opened the show and if his last name sounds familiar, it should. His father is the iconic Steve Earle (another one of my favorites). Justin gets his middle name Townes, from Townes Van Zandt, of whom Steve Earle was a great friend. Justin Townes Earle is definitely more bluesy than his old man and while he seems to be a good performer, only time will tell if he lives up to the musical legacy of his father.","product_id":"8","review_rating":5}

There are over 90 crystal chandeliers, torchieres and sconces in the theater, all but one are original.  The original cost was $3 million back in 1928.  Compare that to the 1987 restoration that cost $43 million.  We had perfect seats, Row AA.  How lucky is that  Loved the performance.  My first time for Wicked.  But just as entertaining is the view of theater.  Love it here.  So beautiful and so ornate.

It is like walking into a little piece of history, I could see the upper crusts socializing in here back in the day. Furs and fedoras, and those long cigarette holders gracing the hallways. This is a gorgeous theater its hard to capture it with pictures because of lighting glares. I have not experienced large playhouses in other cities. But my advice is pick a show you love a decent Broadway one, splurge once a year it will make your experience that much more memorable. Spend a little extra for refreshments yes they are expensive but again the experience. I don't think the upper seats are bad but some on yelp seem to, if it is what you can afford it is still a nice view. And unlike Heinz hall you have a little leg room. There are always a few audience members behaving naughty that was my only complaint. The ushers are helpful and will let you in if you are few minutes late (Grrr that Pittsburgh parking), speaking of parking I would park at the 9th and Penn garage or the one on liberty and ninth if you can. I appreciate this theater for its history and modern contributions, I think some individuals do not understand that this kind of history in other American cities has been left to decay.

I personally love musicals, enjoy plays... so my 1st encounter with ATC was when they're showing The Great American Trailer Park Musical in August 2010.  Cmon people, how can anyone pass that up!!  The performance was GREAT.  The stage is small, which turns out to be one of the reason I like this place.  There is NOT a bad seat.  You can see everything.  By the way, seating is not assigned and 1st come 1st serve.  On a hit show, that can be a problem if you want to sit with your honey (or whoever).  Get there early enough to get your choice seating.  Then I found out about the Pay What You Can Night, which is normally a Wednesday.  That night you will get to enjoy the same show for whatever you can scrap up from your couch (or $10 is suggested).  For people who are on tight budget (hmm... me & lots of my friends), it's a great opportunity and I am very very appreciative of it.  (Check their website for PWYC date for each show)  Drinks & snacks (aka chips & cookies) priced reasonably, $3-5 for beerwine, $1 for a snack pack.  Parking is free and plentiful in the lot next to the building.  Since then I've seen 39 Steps (hilarious... though I don't think that's the original intention) and Every Christmas Story Ever Told (not growing up in the US, I totally missed all the references... so not as funny for me).

It is led by Artistic director Jean Pierre Bonnefoux and his wife Patricia McBride who are world renowned for dancing in the New York City Ballet under George Balanchine. What does that mean for non dance connoisseurs It means young dancers want to come to NCDT from all over the world (literally) to dance under their tutelage which translates to a better experience for patrons.NCDT has always has a great reputation for modern contemporary ballets, but they also excel at classic, storybook ballets like Romeo & Juliet, and funny children's ballets like Cinderella. But their sweet spot (and why they attracted resident choreographer Dwight Rhoden who you may have seen on So You Think You Can Dance) is the innovative contemporary works. In fact their annual Innovative Works in late fall often sells out. It features several short pieces that often have a theme or message.  My favorite piece, Satto, was featured again recently in Director's Choice was originally an Innovative Work. Another one they debuted this year had two male artists partnering with Anna Gerberich and never let her feet touch the ground the whole time. The artists and choreographers ebb and flow but you're always going to see a great show with a wide variety of styles. You may not like every single piece, but at least they're conversation pieces. Similarly, you're not going to love every painting in the Mint. It's worth seeing something other than Nutcracker, so dive in, the water's fine.If I have any complaint, it's that every dancer has a different stylestrength and Jean Pierre seems to have favorite principals that he sometimes over casts. Kind of like John Fox.I grew up watching such dance companies as the SF ballet, Bolshoi, Joffrey Ballet, ODC, Alvin Ailey and the CincinnatiSan Jose ballets so this ain't my first rodeo.Ladies, one more selling point in two words: eye candy. Glistening, muscular athletic men often dancing shirtless. I'm just saying. Sue me.","product_id":"2","review_rating":5}

Great sound, good sight lines, plenty of room to stand up front, and to top it all off, a ceiling of twinkling stars. Parking can be a little tricky, but after going a few times you learn the side streets. Some bands I've seen here include Stars, Bright Eyes, She & Him, Jonny Lang, The Mars Volta, and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs - one of the most memorable shows ever because Karen O. was swilling from a bottle of champagne, fell off the stage, and managed to keep singing the entire time without missing a note or spilling a drop.","product_id":"5","review_rating":3}

It is self-serve frozen yogurt that you add your own toppings to.  They have a bunch of flavors to pick from, so you can mix and match.  They also have loads of fresh fruit, chocolate, sprinkles and even mochi & red bean paste to put on your delish frozen yogurt.  After you pick out everything you want, they weigh it and charge you per ounce.  It is a really fun place to go, and it tasted great!I had pineapple, mango and strawberry fro-yo topped with fresh pineapple, mango, coconut, mochi and kiwi.

So many people not washing their hands, touching the machines, etc. Ahh well.  The tart frozen yogurt is delicious and a healthy addiction! The prices are high too....

This place seems pricey (some $0.47 per ounce), like that one, but the sheer amount of flavors and toppings is overwhelming compared to other stores like it.I had a lactose-free mango frozen yogurt, and some pomegranate-based yogurt. Both were very good, and I had no complaints about them. There were many other flavors available, including the oddly-named \"European tang\".The toppings included yogurt chips, mochi (!!!), a brownie, very fresh fruit (yes, the mango was ripe) and more. The store design is very bright, very pastel and very smart. I might just be back here tomorrow if I'm craving more frozen yogurt. Hopefully I can try some of the more chocolately or crunchy toppings next time.","product_id":"7","review_rating":5}

Despite liking the tartness of PB's original flavor, it just couldn't match up to the variety of flavors, toppings, and the cheap pricing of YL.  Unfortunately, from what I had heard, the only other froyo place with the \"by-the-weight\" model in Chicago was pretty bad.I've known about the one in Champaign for a while but I'd never gone...perhaps due to a fierce loyalty to Jarling's Custard Cup and the Moonstruck that Cocomero replaced.  But, as a lover of froyo I had to see what the fuss was about...Fellow Yelpers, Yogurtland has come to the Midwest.  Tons of flavors, tons of toppings, cheap price, and super happy decor.  And most importantly - it's good.  ESPECIALLY the red velvet froyo.  My friends described my reaction as if I had just saw the love of my life.  In-freaking-tense.

OK well I went shopping too.Cocomero is DIY frozen yogurt and I love that concept. There are a ton of different flavors. Pick one or mix and match. They will also give you taster cups, which are really hard to eat yogurt from. I don't get it. Once you have your yogurt, go to the topping bar and choose what you want. They have all kinds of fruit, nuts and candies. I recommend mochi :) Then, you weigh your creation and pay by the ounce ($.47oz I believe). Sit down or take it to go.

I also appreciate they keep their indoor temperature at normal levels. Who wants to be ice-blasted by the air-con I can actually wear a t-shirt inside, rather than have to bring a sweater with me on a hot summer day.

I've tried bubble tea other places since Jade Mountain opened, but nothing else compares.Their chicken and pork pot stickers are perfect snack food, and the pork ramen is excellent - better than Umami's at half the price.  They have a tendency to run out of the various food items on the menu, but there's usually an equally good alternative available.Throw in friendly staff, casual atmosphere, good prices, wifi, and a rewards program, and Jade Mountain is well worth my commute from the west side.","product_id":"7","review_rating":4}

The workers are always friendly - especially the owners - and you can tell that they try to get to know a lot of their regular customers.  They're also very helpful in answering any questions about the teas and can give recommendations.  Thumbs up on the milk tea, mountain tea (a really unique and great taste), coffee and the fruit teas.  The little desserts are a nice touch and the one I've tried was good.  Their steamed buns are good as well.The only thing I wouldn't recommend is the pork ramen.  My friend and I both tried it and neither of us liked how fatty the pork was.  The ramen is okay but I probably wouldn't order it again for the price.  But overall I find their prices to be very reasonable.","product_id":"7","review_rating":3}

Bubble tea bubble tea bubble tea.(Can you tell I love bubble tea Seriously, it's like a drink and a snack all in one.) I first tried bubble tea at Bubble Island in University SquareEast Campus Mall, and since that went south, I've been searching for bubble tea. And then Steepery came, and I found it. Of course, there are other things to love about Steepery too - mainly the multitude of flavors they offer as add-ins. Where else in the central downtown area can you get a lavender chai latte Also, Steepery's refreshingly tech-savvy for a local shop - they've got an iPad cash register, Belly rewards app, WiFi, all that fun stuff.Only thing I don't like (and this may have changed since the last time I was there) No gift cards. Instead, they do it by pots of tea - you can buy 10 pots, 20, etc. I'd prefer a traditional dollar-amount gift card option, if they haven't started doing it already.EDIT: Five stars, five stars - they do sell gift cards!

{"review_title":"This is semi new, they've been open for at least the last...","review_body":"This is semi new, they've been open for at least the last month or so. But it seems no one has really come out and checked it out. It's located on Ft. Apache and Tropicana to the left of Tropical Smoothie or Mashisoyo. The sign says \"Grand Opening Homemade Ice cream and Boba\", it doesn't have a name on the signs yet so it's hard to see it. All the ice creams are all homemade and made right there in the shop. The prices are not bad at all, for a single scoop it is $2.50, double scoop $3.50, and every extra scoop is another $1. They have many flavors, if you look at my picture you can sort of see the menu (I'll update a little later). The Asian flavors are what stuck out to me the most. They allow free sampling of the flavors, so yes I did try them all and actually liked all of them. One flavor that's not on the menu itself is Durian, but if you ask for it, they'll give it to you. Now this was the first time I ever had Durian, and it was delicious (now I have to try the actual fruit). I've heard it was either a hit or miss with Durian as some people really hate it or really love it. The flavors aren't imitation which you can easily tell after taking a bite into it. I haven't tried the Vegan ice cream yet, but it's non-dairy and it's worth a shot if you're lactose intolerant or vegan. They have waffle cones  bowls which is only an additional 50cents!They have milk tea, slush, and hot tea which all the prices are very fair.They have a stamp card for the boba drinks buy 5 get one 1.I'm not going to take off for service, but I've had some bad run-in's with their service. Owner going on vacation and they close, but when asked for a return date, they either don't know or give me the wrong date. As I love the ice cream I came back several times when they said they were going to be open, to bring my mother who is visiting from out of the country, and they weren't open or were rude. The owner while he was working did not acknowledge me at all while in the store, only acknowledged my friend, which was rather rude. But I'm willing to give him another shot. If I based this review off of service I would only give them 1 star as it was a major disappointment. But alas, the ice cream is well worth it to me.","product_id":"4","review_rating":5}

They are open to making more flavors if there is a demand for them. I love supporting our local small businesses! =D","product_id":"2","review_rating":4}
{"review_title":"Putting aside the fact that when i first went, they had...","review_body":"Putting aside the fact that when i first went, they had some bad impressions (owner on vacation, closed shop for over a week, no ingredients to make ice cream to replenish stock, etc). If i based the review on that only, i'd probably give them 1-2 stars. But i gave them many chances to recover.Located on the SW corner of Tropicana and Ft Apache, next door to Tropical Smoothie (take note the address from yelp, on more than one occassion, has led the person to the area down the street). Easy way to get to this place would be turning right at the Hobby Lobby sign on Ft apache, and then taking a left. I had first heard about this place from a friend, saying they had durian ice cream. i was ecstatic to hear this news and been waiting a LONG time to try this place. There are 3 different \"areas\" of ice cream. First is the normal type containing like chocolate, banana chocolate, pistachio, etc. Second is the asian type containing green tea, lychee, taro, black sesame, ginger, mango, durian, and guava. Last but not least, something catered to the lactose intolerant, 100% non-dairy ice cream, with flavors of i believe vanilla, chocolate, and mango All the ice cream is made by the owner himself, Peter Wong. He lets you try as many flavors as you want, and he gives you a decent amount (way more than other places for samples). Something good to note is all the ice creams are not overly sweet. They are sweet but very fragrant. All of the ice cream are soft, and very smooth. I've tried most of the asian flavors, including some of the normal, and one of the non-dairy style. Starting by my favorite type, asian flavors ! My least favorite is probably the ginger. There is a slight spice from the ginger that you can taste. Nothing spicy but its like a subtle but noticeable spice. The taro is one of the lighter ones as well. Fragrant , light, with very small taro bits. No artificial coloring (not deep purple like you see in stores, but like very very light purple).The mango and lychee are nice. Sweeter, but fragrant depending on the fruit. The guava (new) is nice. Really fragrant, not too sweet. Out of the \"ordinary\" asian flavored ice cream. The last two is black sesame and durian (so i just noticed ive never tried green tea... hmm) first the black sesame. Made with actual ground black sesame. VERY fragrant. Slightly sweet. Its like the ice cream version of the hot black sesame soup dessert. i love it ! And last but not least, durian. BE WARNED. this is one of the asian fruits where you either will love it, or hate it. It has a very distinct flavor and smell. This is my favorite, along with the black sesame. the durian has a light yellow color. Gives off the actual durian fragrance that you'd expect from the fruit. Same for the taste as well. Very fragrant, slightly sweet. As for the normal flavors, i havent had the chance to try yet, ive been stuck on the asian flavors, but when i visited today, Peter let me try a new creation of his, which was the banana chocolate chip. He said its made with real bananas ! this flavor was really fragrant in terms of the banana. not too sweet either. Honestly, almost rather prefer it without the chocolate chip. the chocolate chip makes it kind of weird Now last but not least, something a lot of places dont offer. 100% non-dairy ice cream. When i had first visited this place, my uncle was complaining about not being able to try any because of his lactose intolerance. Luckily, Peter just created (that day..) something new. 100% non dairy ice cream. My uncle was super happy. Peter was very careful, made sure to not use a scoop that was prior used in the other ice creams. As i had said earlier, there was 3 flavors he had made. When he was getting a sample for my uncle, he said the ice cream was made earlier, and has not completely set yet, but because its been maybe 1-2 hours since freezing process started, there are some areas he was able to get that was solidified. I forgot which flavor was tasted but the texture and flavor was good. Of course its not as fragrant as if using normal dairy products, but it was still good for what it is. Flavorful, semi sweet, and of course, smooth. Highly recommended place for ice cream. Prices are very good as well.Starting at $2.50 for 1 scoop up to $5.50 for 4 scoops. They aren't small scoops either ! :D","product_id":"3","review_rating":3}

Give them a call before you head over. Besides the after school crowd, their business is not steady throughout the rest of the day and they tend to close early. The second note; they make all of their ice creams fresh and will run out of the fun ones. I had my heart set on durian or black sesame, but both flavors were out. Instead my sister and I shared the pink guava and lychee. Both these light and sweet fruits complimented each other well. We ended up taking a little of both in each bite. If a bolder flavor was paired with either, their subtle characteristics would have been masked.All of their flavors are made in house with no added colors or preservatives. The scoops are generous. The staff are warm and gracious. All of these components made the disappointment of not getting what I came for bearable. Just call ahead of time to see if they are open and fully stocked.","product_id":"9","review_rating":5}

The filipino lady working here is pretty awesome. I came in with 3 other friends and of course we asked for samples. :P She pretty much gave us a scoop of all the flavors that we wanted to try. Honestly, we could've had our fill from just the samples but they were just too freakin good. She was patient and took the time to chat with us which I really appreciated.2star: Flavors. This is no ordinary ice cream shop with your typical vanilla chocolate.. its EXOTIC. By exotic I mean, pink guava, black sesame, durian, taro, lychee, mango, green tea, etc etc. No where else in the Las Vegas valley have I found these flavors at an ice cream shop. ANNNNNDDD all are hand made by the owner. What I liked most about it was that all the flavors weren't overly sweet.. you mainly got the flavor. 3star: Price. Cheap cheap cheap. 1 scoop was about $2.50 and the prices go up from there. They also offer waffle bowls and other toppings and you can also get a pint to take home for less than $5 bucks. Thats freakin awesome.4star: Atmosphere. Though the shop is small, there are table and chairs. The lady honestly didn't mind us sitting for half an hour just chatting. In fact, she even came and chatted with us. I can definitely see this as a hang out spot to meet with friends over some ice cream and boba. Especially during the summer time. 5star: Just because I feel like it. They are great!!!Please don't let this place die!!

One of the best impressions of a place from the beginning.The lady that works there is so nice and even opened the place early (an hour before it was supposed to open) when we were waiting outside to realize that it wasn't opened yet. In addition, she gives samples if you ask to try. And she doesn't gip you off the samples either. She lets you try what you want and is very patient and welcoming. The Asian flavors are so unique! Probably the only place I know that makes such interesting flavors from durian, pink guava, black sesame, green tea, lychee, mango, red bean, ginger to taro. What is even more special is that the lady that works there along with her business partner make the ice cream themselves. You can definitely taste the different of homemade ice cream.The price is really good deal for the portion. One scoop is 2.50, two scoops 3.50, and a pint for 4.50. I generally am against having anything durian due to its smell. However, if you get past the first 'impression' of the durian ice cream, it is really good. It has the durian ice cream with a mix of vanilla ice cream I think. I had tried it during the sample, and decided order it as one of the scoops of two.Black sesame is by far my favorite there. If you have had the Chinese sesame balls in sweet soup, it taste exactly like that except in cold form. It is creamy and not too sweet like other ice creams. And if you are person who likes ginger candy or like the taste of ginger, ginger flavor is definitely a must-try. It does have a strong ginger flavor like durian ice cream, however, if you can get past that first impression, it has a rather soothing aftertaste.Also, if you are a person who doesn't want to try the Asian exotic flavors, they do have many other flavors to try.Furthermore, this place is really cozy and the owner was willing to let us hang out there and catch up with friends. The lady that worked there even came up to us at one point to chat with us. Last but not least, this place is not just for ice cream. They do sell various drinks as well. Definitely will come and try other flavors here again.","product_id":"10","review_rating":4}

Props to Mr. Wong for making such delicious ice cream flavors with fresh ingredients, especially the Asian ones! Love that they have the typical green tea, lychee, mango, taro, and red bean, but the ones that stand out is the black sesame, ginger, and the infamous durian. Coming from someone who almost kicked a friend out of the car for drinking a fresh durian smoothie, I have to say that their durian flavor is the only exception I'd make for the spiky, smelly fruit.Their prices are so reasonable given the small mountain of ice cream they give you! Dishing out the $3.50 for two huge scoops is a bargain, given how they make the ice cream in house. You could get a pint here for $4.50, and it'd be better than the stuff at the Asian markets.The Filipina lady seriously reminds me of my mom (in a good way, I promise). Friendly, generous, and personable! She served up a sample equivalent to a whole scoop of all the requested flavors for my three friends and I to split. Not only that, but she was genuinely interested in getting to know us too. Almost felt like I was at home there. How often does that happen these daysYou might get brain freeze while enjoying their cheap, chilly treats, but trust me, you won't get the cold shoulder here.","product_id":"3","review_rating":5}

I don't even care if it's 40-30 degrees out, the cold won't stop me from devouring their ice cream. I know they offer other stuff like boba drinks, but for now I plan on trying all of their ice cream flavors. I'm glad a business like this exists here in the valley. I love privately-owned establishments compared to chains. The attention to detail and quality is definitely better. The Filipina lady is charming and very accommodating. Just like Jaimie Y said, she reminds you of that aunt (or in her case, her mother) that is willing to feed you whenever you come to visit or something. NOT TO MENTION THEY HAVE VEGAN ICE CREAM!!

The taro was light, I couldn't really taste much of the taro in it, but it was still good and fragrant. The guava was good too, it was made from pink guava, really light in color, but really good, I loved it enough to take some home. The green tea is good too, tastes a lot better then the ones you find in other stores or prepackaged ones, tastes just like the ones I find in Japan. Black sesame is sweeter then the rest, at least to me it is but it's still really good. The regular flavors I've tried a bunch of them and they're all good, not so sweet as I would find american ice cream to be, but there is still a sweet sense to them all. One that stood out was the banana chocolate chip, but I don't like the added chocolate chip to the banana ice cream, but it's still good. I would actually like to see just banana ice cream by itself.","product_id":"10","review_rating":3}

First, I'll start with the downfall... because I can only think of one. The wait at the drive-through is extremely long, it could be sped up quite a bit because it doesn't actually save time from what it would take to park and walk in. I was the only customer in the drive-through, after placing my order I spent about 5 minutes waiting at the window -- longer than expected, but tolerable.However, on the plus side there's a DRIVE-THROUGH.  Although it may take less time to just park and walk inside, the benefit of having a drive-through is that you don't have to get ready in the morning or late at night. The drive-through and shop are open 24 hours a day...how many more ways can I say \"amazing\"Next - I love boba tea and usually have to drive 20 minutes to Chandler for a decent one from Boba Tea House in Lee Lee's market place complex. Not anymore! This place also sells my favorite taro milk tea. Finally, not only was the staff extremely friendly (almost overly friendly, but in a positive way), the donuts are delicious and fresh -- I'd recommend this place over the big chains (Dunkin Donuts, Krispy Kreme) any day!

I noted it was within relatively easy biking distance of the ASU campus, which was exciting since I've been looking for a donut shop that can fit that distinction. I asked my friends to choose which donuts they wanted off of the menu I found and despite the late hour at which I went there was an ample amount of each kind to pick from.The donuts themselves were soft and tasted fresh, particularly the donut holes. I didn't heat them up when I got back since my friends didn't have a microwave in their dorm room, but I'm sure they would have tasted even better warm. And better than their donuts was their boba tea, the special signifier for my 5 star rating.I went for a taro flavored boba smoothie, which I've had before at other boba tea establishments. While I usually enjoy taro smoothies, the way they prepared theirs made it possibly one of the most delicious things I've ever had the pleasure to drink. The taste was akin to the scent of a pumpkin spice candle, but in creamy purple smoothie form. They didn't skimp on the tapioca either. Absolutely perfect drink, even on my chilly bike ride back to my dorm.

Same for the Cake they make them there but they only offer whipped cream frosting and fresh flowers to put on top, bring your own topper and ribbon to put around the cake as well. I had my wedding upstairs where the lighting is not to good either. But I have to say my friends and family loved the place, they are still telling me on how that was the best and most fun wedding they have ever been to. So for the price this place is the best!

What caught my eyes were the sign that says 'crossing ducks' http:www.yelp.combiz_photoscSVmQusncacVHsCHObA1Ggselect=FeK9GKxNBVIGdQlp-FASFwFeK9GKxNBVIGdQlp-FASFw Made me smile :)Take a look at the website : http:www.tempe.govindex.aspxpage=774there's many activities you can do with your family and friends. Oh my, did I mention There's a wave pool inside of the recreation center! You heard me! Wave pool! How cool is that :D There's also a fitness center (might need to be a member), tennis court, volleyball (my favorite!), batting cage, and some rentals (ask them for specific rentals). Seriously can spend a day here. Make sure to watch your children if you are walking near the lake because there is no barrier. Keep your kids by your side just for safely. There are ducks and probably random fishes in the lake. You can fish at the lake, but I wouldn't suggest to take the fishes home to eat. D: So glad this park is just 5 min walk from his place in Arizona. Will come back, maybe next time I'll bring my dog. :)","product_id":"2","review_rating":5}

IT is a giant pond,you can take little water crafts on it.  It has ducks and fish as well. They also have a lot of covered Picnic areas with grills so you can have Birthday Parties and such. All well lit also. Along with clean(as clean as you can get for a park) toliet areas. Lots of rolling hills for exercise or to bring your dog.Our dog loves coming here. It is like disney land for her.On the other side is the grat wave pool, and a great gym. The park offers all sorts of classes and sports leauges for all ages.Lots of places for kids to play.It is just great! The only thing I am not crazy about is on the weekends they sometimes also parties and get togethers here that drive me nuts. Because, the music will start early in the morning and go all night.It can really be loud at times even with your doors and windows closed.Unfortunatly I live close enough to hear it. But, if you have kids or dogs, it is a lot of fun and a great place to explore.","product_id":"4","review_rating":4}

Ever since I moved to Tempe in 2008, I lived super close to Tempe Town Lake. I was in love with running at that park, but now I live on the south end of Tempe and TTL is really not convenient in the morning rush hour traffic. Once I discovered that Kiwanis was basically my \"down the road neighbor,\" I have been going regularly. I love to run in the mornings with my dog before the weather gets too hot for him. I think Kiwanis may just be his new favorite place because he loves to chase ducks! This park, while much smaller than TTL, has a ton of ducks, fish, turtles and other types of birds that call the lake their home. You see people with nets and fishing poles out there fishing all times of the day. There is also a huge playground for kids, many pavilions and grills for family get togethers and sometimes they play a movie on a big projection screen in the park. If you're an outdoorsy person, definitely check out Kiwanis Park!","product_id":"5","review_rating":5}
{"review_title":"Kiwanis has everything a rec center needs to be considered...","review_body":"Kiwanis has everything a rec center needs to be considered one of the best. Right to the point, if you ask me. I'll cover it all, but regardless of age, they have all the bases covered. Lets dive into Kiwanis (we can dive into the wave pool later!)~What To Do~What can't you do If you are a child, they offer sports classes up the ying yang like the non-competitive program Sportball all the way to fun swimming classes in the huge pool, no matter the skill level. For adults, the tennis courts are outstanding, as is the fitness room too! Finally, for the older crowd, they have many fun programs available for you to stay active and happy!~The Good~I really feel that to be a true RECREATION center, you have to be able to provide a large variety of programming for the masses. Kiwanis, in my eyes, offers just that and more. They offer the largest variety of programming I have found in the valley. With me personally being a sports coach, I have been to many city rec centers, and no center is the same. This center is at the top of the food chain. They also offer a batting range, A BATTING RANGE. Do this equation: Batting Range + Wave Pool + Gym + Tennis Courts + Awesome Staff = Bonkers Good Facility. Just stop by with your child, sit down to the left and look through their program guide....you will see the breadth of their course offerings..then you will see the huge wave pool behind the desk and be sold!~The Bad~It is an older facility, and being so, there are some visible areas where they could do some minor renovations. However they just re-did the bathrooms and also touched up the walking areas near the softball fields, so you can't say they aren't trying. My biggest complaint is parking, which is situated in bulk on the opposite sides of the center. It makes for a relatively long walk no matter which side you park on. They have a minor row of parking right up front, however if you come anytime really after open on a weekend, don't bother trying to find a spot up front. In the hot summer months, that can be a bit of a nuisance, but really that is worst it gets here....parking... haha :-)~The Down Low~This is my favorite center to teach at. I prefer it over all others. It is the largest, has more options than others, has spacious grass to frolic on (I said 'frolic' in a review, life is complete now), and the staff here are extremely helpful and courteous each time I converse with them. Like I said earlier, just come down and grab a pamphlet with programming info, you will be very happy. Message me if you have questions about programming, I am glad to help!!!","product_id":"9","review_rating":4}

For residents, all of this is free of charge and as the other review stated, for guests, its a nominal $5 fee.

My partner and I did a tasting of their food, thinking we'd try to meet with at least two to three of the vendors, but after tasting the food (and getting zero response from the other caterer we'd outreached to) we decided to go with All the Best and we were both so glad we did. They were the most reasonably priced of all the listed caterers and I have to say,  going with All the Best, we really felt we got a lot of bang for our buck.The food was delicious and plentiful and the service was truly great - they thought of things my partner and I never would have. All of our guests raved about the food. Even though we got the stereotypical \"wedding food\" it was GOOD wedding food. I highly recommend them for catered events - plus, as a bonus, they own Pittsburgh BBQ company, so we were able to get mini pulled pork sliders as an appetizer, which everyone loved!","product_id":"2","review_rating":4}

{"review_title":"I hosted a bachelorette party for my sister at this...","review_body":"I hosted a bachelorette party for my sister at this location and overall everything was wonderful. There were a few customer service issues I had that I'd like to mention so that others are aware. 1- I booked the block of rooms 3 months in advance via the 1-800 number on the website. I have a military ID and requested the military discount. I was given the discounted rate for all 5 rooms and was told I only needed to present my ID upon arrival. Unfortunately, when I arrived the girl at the check-in counter told me that I could not have all 5 rooms at the discounted rate, that I could only have two of them. I pitched a royal fit and 40 minutes later they gave me all 5 rooms at the rate that I was quoted. Bad way to start a fun occasion.2- I emailed back and forth with Tracy Bernstein about specifics that I needed for this gathering I was hosting (iPod player, Microwave, Fridge, Early Check-in). I was told these things would be ready and they were not. We never got the iPod player, Microwave or Fridge. Bad customer service, Tracy.NOW, I'd like to tell you about the wonderful things at Holiday Inn City Center. 1- Very clean and modern. I loved the decor and it made great back drops for my photography.2- The rooms had adjoining doors which made it very easy for our guests to mingle.3- Jay Jay at the front desk was so friendly and helpful. He arranged a private limo service for us beautiful ladies for a great price. I've been told he has the \"hookup\" so make sure you get with him if you need anything special. 4- Adam is the food and beverage manager and he was so good to me. He offered to bring a 6 foot table in to our room with table cloths for FREE. Are you serious FREE He even came by the room to make sure we got all that I requested and warn us about the no noise policy starting at 11pm. We very happily toned it down by that point. The stay at the hotel was wonderful and the event was great. I really appreciate all that helped me at the hotel to make this event special!","product_id":"7","review_rating":3}
{"review_title":"I stayed at this particular holiday inn last week If you...","review_body":"I stayed at this particular holiday inn last week  If you check my previous reviews I always stay in a holiday inn or candlewood when I travel (IHG brand).  While 9 out of 10 are good experiences this one takes the cake.  Based on yelp reviews we knew ahead of time about the parking fee (it is unavoidable in the center of the city)At least it is only a 1 time fee and they validate it for your stay.  After parking we go to hotel lobby to check in and were greeted by a very nice and helpful receptionist (I wish I remembered her name).  She told us that we had the best room in the entire hotel, and I truly believe it. Our room was 15th floor room 1534.  It was on the corner so we got 2 walls of windows, one side had a great view of uptown (not the arena which is behind the hotel), and the ceilings were over 12 feet high. Our king bed was comfy as always, and I always fall asleep quickly on them.The hotel itself is furnished in a contemporary style, and will appeal to 9 out of 10 people.  It is located one block from the Epicenter, and only a block or two from the lightrail system for easy commuting.    The one time we had to leave parking was to travel about 3.5 miles to go to an auditorium (we saw Wicked, and it was fantastic).  Other than that there was no reason to drive anywhere since you are close to everything in uptown.  In the beginning of my post I said that my boyfriend and myself always stay in a variety of the Holiday Inn brand hotels.  For anybody looking into hotels, I suggest you sign up for their rewards system, whether or be this one (priority club) or another chains version of it.  Hotels reward loyalty, and will do a lot to keep you loyal.  We did our research and liked the IHG brand (everything from Holiday inn express to Intercontinental)for a few reasons; they are literally everywhere so we knew that when we travel we can stay with them and continue earning points, and price-wise they stay competitive.  Our room preferences are already saved to our account (free to create).  So as a tip to everybody do a little research into hotels rewards programs, then stick to it.  If you stay with a hotel chain ten times a year, they will do a little more to keep you happy, and make up for any bad experiences you might have along the way. When I first started out with my Priority Club membership I highly doubt they would have upgraded me to the 15th floor with some of best views in the whole hotel, but because of my loyalty to them they rewarded me (at no additional cost).  The room was only $97, and that really can't be beat  for this location.","product_id":"2","review_rating":3}

Kelly Matthews was my catering lead and Jessica also helped on the day of the event.My expectations were dramatically exceeded. I would recommend them to anyone for these reasons:1. Flexibility - As an out-of-town bride, Kelly was quick in responses, edits to estimates and suggestions to queries via email since I couldn't attend in-person meetings too often.2. Professionalism - Team worked so I didn't have to think about anything on the day of the wedding. They even prepared plates and drinks for my husband and I so that we didn't wait in the buffet line and had a few minutes at our table to eat before crowds arrived. Jessica helped by directing us during the event as well and giving us heads up on timings. In addition to food, they helped set up decor - even lit lanterns and candles on tables!3. Fair Prices - I wanted interesting food combinations, which doesn't usually go hand-in-hand with reasonable pricing for a big event. However, Kelly was great in offering many choices and speaking to the chef several times to ensure we had great variety.4. Presentation - Food was displayed beautifully. Kelly gave helpful suggestions on how to set up the buffet for good crowd flow throughout the event. My favorite presentation was a small bamboo plate with a BBQ slider and homemade potato chips - delish!5. Quality - I received a lot of questions about who did my catering from friends who are also in the wedding planning mode. Guests loved the food and flavors were appealing to all.Again, can't recommend them enough - definitely add them to your list when interviewing caterers!","product_id":"2","review_rating":5}

Being a foodie and someone who works in the industry, I have pretty high standards. I certainly didn't make it easy on them! We brought La-Tea-Da's on as our caterer at the last minute. Seriously last minute - like a week before. Did I mention my wedding was multicultural and I wanted to include a good amount of Venezuelan and Spanish inspired dishes Janet met with me to discuss the menus only days before the wedding, and she put my mind at ease instantly. All of the challenges I thought would be insurmountable, namely my eclectic taste in food, only seemed to excite her more as she threw out creative solutions and suggestions with the enthusiasm of a kid in a candy store. In the end, I wound up with my dream menu. Incredible passed hors d'oeuvres, Paella, tapas, shrimp & grits, ceviche, gazpacho, tacos, sushi, a Venezuelan parilla station, late night philly cheese steak sliders, and more somehow all came together beautifully to create one of the best food experiences I've ever had. My guests consistently echo my sentiments as well. My only regret was not taking the time to eat even more (though it wasn't for lack of trying on the part of the staff! We arrived to the reception venue to a lovely candlelit sampling for two while the cocktail hour wrapped up and the amazing staff diligently kept our cups and plates full the whole night.) I could go on and on, but let's just say I'm anxiously awaiting a ten year vow renewal of some sort so I can call La-Tea-Da's up and do it all again.","product_id":"4","review_rating":3}

Anyway...saw Crandalls in Madison Magazine and the photos stood out to me. I didn't want to drive to the East Side for the Esquire Club. I was reluctant to try take out fish fry because I was worried about fried food getting soggy. I gave it a shot and I was impressed! First, the fish to beading ratio was really good. Big thick pieces of flaky fish with a dense, probably corn meal based, and crumb-style breaking (as opposed to the extra greasy tempura- style batter). It was nice and crunchy and the breading stayed that way on my 5-10 minute drive home. Tip: crack the styrofoam container to let the steam out for extra insurance against soggy fish. Served with a lemon. The fries were coated in something that made them extra crispy and they had a good seasoning. The slaw had good flavor but lots of dressing. Purists might say it was over dressed; others might say its just right. Tarter sauce was a little sweet and tangy, which was good contrast with the fish. The server gladly gave me extra. The bun was just as you would expect from a supper club, cheap, white, and doughy. Served with a butter chip. Everything was served together in a box; everything you need except several icy cold beers.The service was fine. The take out window was nice. It takes a few minutes for the order but I think they fry-to-order which is well worth it to me and a big plus. Any you cut it, it takes less time than waiting in line for dine in Friday Fish Fry.A little spendy for take out fish fry ringing up at over $25 for two dinners. That would be more than fair if I could park my fat ass there all night and eat all-you-can-eat. It's worth it though and I'll be back.","product_id":"9","review_rating":4}

They informed us that our host were not there yet, but we were welcome to roam around the place.  They had arts and crafts everywhere.  Interesting facts and information on the walls.  When our host arrived we follow our guide to a back area (filled with trees and tableschairs for outdoor activities) and then to a building in the back for our party.  We had the whole back building to ourselves.  It was nice!  Tables, chairs, and art canvasesart supplies all set up.  Signs wishing our birthday girl (with her name on it).  The room has it's own bathrooms so you do not need to run back to the main building.  We had 1-12 hours in the back room.  Then we were free to enjoy the museum.  There are two separate areas artscraft & playlearn room.  I had fun along with the kids.","product_id":"7","review_rating":3}

We recently took an instrument to be looked at for repair and the guy fixed it on the spot, no charge. Of course, we ended up spending money in the store anyways, so it was a win-win for Buchanan Music and myself.

He made sure we got a good guitar this time.  And about 6 months later, the guitar needed some adjustments and Russ did it.  The guitar plays beautifully and we appreciate Russ' talent in working on guitars.  You can tell he loves the instrument and is a master craftsman.We appreciate your work, Russ.

I could sit in a theater all day, all week, all year long and do nothing but gaze at live performances of theatrical talent. lol! Well in actuality, hmmmmmmm I really could. I am not even joking on that. I probably would if someone brought me water every now and again. LOL!  Ok, seriously now, Childsplay is my favorite organization in Az for a host of reasons.    My dear friends of Childsplay know who they are. This is children's theater at it's best! The Q and A sessions after each show is a plus. The kids love it. I have to admit I do too since I get to go say hi to my friends after each stage-show. I also learn more techniques that I can steal when I teach drama to my inner city students. Teehee!  ( Yes I am a teacher and yes I would die to have some of their costumes and sets)    I have seen so many wonderful plays, literature remakes, and original scripts performed At TCPA and by Childsplay. Fernidad, BFG and New Kid were only some of the most amazing masterpieces I have had the distinct pleasure of viewing from these talented actors. Debbie, Scott, Katie, Jodi; well all of them! LOVE YOU!   Childsplay also has an artist in Residence program for schools. We have had an artist at our school for several years. It is wonderful to note that the teaching techniques classroom teachers are learning are helping tomorrows future. Time after time I have seen struggling kids blossom under their tutelage.     Of importance to note, TCPA is a beautiful facility. You can enjoy a nice venue along with the superstar talent. What more can you ask for     The only negative I can possibly imagine is that in today's hard times the cost may be inhibiting to some families. But if you like them on Facebook they sometimes have discounted tickets and contests to win free tickets. A great way to start viewing them and get involved.    I do hope everyone continues to support the arts here in Az. As I have stated in my other \"ARTS\" reviews, I do worry about cultural program survival in Az with recent state budget cuts.

The actors are phenomenal and the bees knees at their craft.  Their costumes and sets hypnotize me and reel me in from the get go.  I love their Q&A sessions at the end of each play and the fact that they have a set of questions you can take home with you for the car ride back.  They use literature for the majority of their plays and have new shows every single year.  But what is even better is their traveling shows they send to schools around the valley and country.  If you are lucky enough to get a grant for them to come, you get shows that are just as good as those in the Tempe Performing Arts Center.  Their sets are smaller, but they have their amazing costumes, props, and music along with them.  They still do Q&A sessions after these traveling shows and give us teachers those same questions that they do at the TPAC shows.  It doesn't matter if you are an adult without kids...everyone should attend at least one Childsplay show in their lifetime.  You are missing out if you don't!","product_id":"8","review_rating":3}

Adult games!The Homestead (Pittsburgh) location of Dave & Busters is just one of the almost 50 locations across the country - from New York to Florida to California - - from Canada to Mexico.  The Dave & Busters idea was conceived in Little Rock, Arkansas back in the 1970s. Two different businesses (one a popular watering hole & one a game & entertainment business) were right next door to each other. The two young owners were friends and quickly realized that combining their businesses made perfect sense. So they opened the first combined D & B in  . . . . no, not Little Rock, but Dallas! To this day there are no D & B's in Little Rock. Not sure what is up with that! But lots of other cities have been the beneficiaries of these two friends combining their businesses.The one in Pittsburgh is the only one I have ever been to.  When I lived there, a group of friends and co-workers (and me, of course!)used to go there for Happy Hour & Power Hour . . . . at least once a week. We had a blast!  A great place to kick-back and let the worries of the work day melt away.Wonder if they'll ever open one in Marin County, CA Shucks!  Probably not. Not a Marin County scene, for sure. WHAT A BLAST IT WAS THOUGH! I miss going to D & B. They have all the classics, like billiards & shuffleboard, plus over 200 interactive & video games. A rechargable Power Card provides an easy way to access all the games.  POWER HOUR is game HAPPY HOUR - - an entire hour of classic and video games for just  ten bucks.  A GREAT BAR, WONDERFUL FOOD AND SERVICE! A RELAXING AND FUN WAY to spend a Friday or Saturday evening. You'll never want to leave. Meet your friends here, grab a beer and a burger or steak and hit the games. Time will just evaporate . . . . while you laugh and drink with your favorite girl, your best friend or even your boss!

We'd never dream of eating there because we like healthy yuppie food. And we only drink cheap drafts OR drink cocktails during happy hour.Your visit is largely determined by time of day, expectations and whether or not you eat their food. If you come on a Friday night, the lines will be long. You'll pay $150 for the two of you to eat, drink and play for 3 hours and you'll be left with a very sour taste in your mouth.The staff is really excellent; any issue with a game not paying out tickets results in immediate help and extra tickets or a swipe for a different game from an employee. Note the \"drinks are weak\" reviews. Also notice it was people buying shots and ordering multiple drinks per person. That's typical white trash behavior. Bartenders here are savvy; they mirror the behavior of the guests. All of our drinks have been consistently strong and well put together because we're courteous and tip well. I have witnessed bartenders bypass tattooed, loud guests and address me and take my order first. This is rational, logical behavior. Also note the \"prize center games suck\" comments. You're supposed to stack tickets over multiple visits and use them on a big prize. Like life, delaying gratification nets you bigger returns. Every other visit I've seen someone walk out with a video game system (Wii, Xbox360 and even a few Xbox One's). The thing about Dave & Busters is the crowd changes depending on day of week and time of day. Sunday afternoon it's all families and Friday and Saturday night it's all drunk 20 somethings. The atmosphere changes and that's why the reviews are all over the place.This review is based on 8ish months of 1-3monthly visits. Most visits are 5 stars, some are 4 stars.Using survey receipts for Buy Ten Get Ten, avoiding Wednesday, Friday or Saturday evenings (and Sunday afternoon, families) and avoiding the food entirely and drinking cheaply, you'll have a great experience for $25-40person.I really enjoy the staff too, they split the difference between fun and professional.

Pgh Happy Hour is a facebook group of friends that like to check out new 'watering holes' every thursday and it's run by a guy that seems to party 247 while still holding down a very lucrative full time job.  Anyway- Pgh HH was celebrating an anniversary and chose D&B for the location.  The D&B staff set up the back 'pool room' with complimentary,  enormous spread of appetizers with dips and kept refilling them when they got low.  Our server, Carla, was very attentive and friendly- making sure we were aware of the specials and checking back often when our glasses got to the half way point.  The other server back there was working equally as hard but I never got the chance to get her name.  I had been here one other time for an organized happy hour for a past employer and remember very similar service but I never got the chance to give them any credit.

As an avid Rock Bottomer, hands down I have never in my life had a better spicy spinach cheese dip than I have had here at Rock Bottom. Whether I have eaten dinner or not before I come down to the restaurant, my favorite and my food of choice is the ENORMOUS Ball park pretzels with the cheese dip. It is a meal itself! The mixture of onions, cheese, spinach and tomatoes is perfection! Another favorite of mine is the Barbecue Chicken Pizza, it has a great kick to it and it's big enough for two people.

They take the time to work with you, to educate you, and to make you feel special. I can make up classes whenever needed, and  in the three months I've been going there, I haven't yet found them to be closed due to some family emergency or out of school function. Both Ms. Pam and Ms. Angelica are dedicated to ensure that you get the most benefit in your class. They work with you, one on one, and make sure you are comfortable during class. They genuinely care about you! I've also seen what they do with children of all ages, and I am very impressed. The school also has great specials (a \"try before  you buy\"), and participate in most local community activities (and NEVER need to close the school to do so!). I'm impressed and proud to be a member of this \"family\", and feel that I have made good friends with both the instructors and fellow students!","product_id":"3","review_rating":5}

Sensei Rick is dedicated to the art of martial arts, as well as the sport. He focuses on the basics, knowing that a strong foundation in karate is what leads to strong fighting. In this dojo, there are many philosophies, but the essential one is to always \"Kick. Punch. Sweat.\" The dojo is made up of hardworking individuals, and the path to a blackbelt is not for everyone.If you were to talk to Sensei, you would see he is dedicated to the community; each year the dojo participates in toy drives and hosts a Karate Kamp; which is an opportunity for kids to participate in karate during the summer.I believe the best way to get a sense of the dojo is to visit it yourself; it is kept neat and clean, and even features a study center so that students can also focus on their academics between training. I highly recommend Mountainside Martial Arts","product_id":"9","review_rating":5}

This dojo is deliberate in creating a balance between kata, kumite (sparring), and basics.  It is also set as a traditional Japanese dojo teaching Wado Ryu Karate.  This is not a cut-throat plaza mall dojo, like the Cobra Kai in \"Karate Kid\", that teaches students to harm each other and fight as a primary resource to resolving a physical confrontation.  If you are looking for a fight club, look elsewhere.That being said, my son specializes in fighting here and does very well.  He has participated in over 30 tournaments in AZ, CA, UT, CO, and NV.  He has won several of these, and usually medals at every event. He is part of a competition team that takes extra time to train in fighting and competing.  I am confident in his abilities.The dojo is restructuring, and growing, and all for the better.  It has the best workshops, training clinics, guest speakers, and REAL tournament training by far.  I couldn't be more proud to recommend it to anyone looking for polished and professional, traditional Japanese technique and practical self-defense instruction.","product_id":"9","review_rating":5}

My son has been training with the Sensei's of MMAC since 2006, starting in their program held at the Ahwatukee YMCA at the age of 7.

Ray Hughes Sensei has got to be one of the best role models in the Martial Arts community. Both Hughes Sensei and Tyler Sensei are incredible with kids, they keep their attention, make the classes fun, but most importantly they properly teach their students how and when to defend themselves. The programs are not only for children, but for all ages, including adults. In fact there are several intense seminars dedicated to adult training, focusing on developing both the mind and body to properly defend itself. Basic class setup: Starts of with stretching, cardio, basically a quick warmup. Next a quick meditation (the dojo is a stress free environment, meditation is to help calm your mind). Then you go through basic form drills (to ensure you have correct footing, hand placement, and momentum). Towards the end, there might be sparing drills (safety first, all students are required to wear padding for arms, legs, and a mouth guard). Class is finished off with another meditation to unwind the body. The main focus of the dojo is teaching Wado, but there are other floors dedicated for Jujitsu and other Martial Arts Programs. Great, clean facility. Near the Ice Den, so plenty of parking. Located in a safe area. Quality wooden floors in the smaller rooms, and padding on the main floor to ensure maximum safety. Clean, cold water fountain. Air conditioned, fans to circulate air. Well lit. Spacious locker rooms, clean bathrooms. Well stocked inventory with padding and gis (uniforms) for all sizes. No contracts, just a monthly payment, if you dedicate yourself to the classes and really want to learn, then it is well worth the money!","product_id":"1","review_rating":3}

The two teachers, Ray and Tyler are incredibly funny, entertaining, and know how to relate to kids phenomenally. Truly, I enjoy watching the entire class just to see the teachings and interactions between the sensei and students. The price is reasonable for classes, especially if you partake in the twice weekly option. They're flexible about makeups, too.My daughter is learning karate but also gaining confidence in a beautiful way. It's hard to describe but her experience is so much more than just karate. She's learning to speak in front of a group, getting exercise, having manners instilled more, and having fun at the same time. From what I gather talking with other parents, there are a lot of satisfied families who have been customers for many many years. I look forward to doing the same. Oh... and they had a Halloween party (2014) and I was blown away at the event they put on. It just goes to show how much they truly love these kids.

In the beginning I resoned that Karate would be a good physical outlet for my well being. Before long I recognized so many more benefits. I began to notice a growth in my self confidence, along with a sense of accomplishment which sparked a feeling of pride in my acheivements. I began to have higher expectations for myself. I started to push myself towards goals and on Feb. 2, 2013 I earned my yellow belt. That is when I realized that Karate is much more than a physical work out. It is a joy to witness the level of respect between the instructors and the students. At any age, young or old, I am a firm believer that Karate teaches focus. It helps with self confidence and self-esteem and it pushes you to set and reach your goals through perserverance, and it all happens in a fun atmosphere with instructors that are dedicated to show you how to achieve such self growth.","product_id":"1","review_rating":5}

My son loves Coach Ed and the gym! He always enjoys his classes and is growing stronger every day. I only intended to keep him at the gym through the summer months but then my 8 year old saw the boys team practicing and decided he wanted to do join too! So here we are a year later and my boys really love the gym! We live in south Las Vegas but I drive there because that's where they want to be! Compared to other gyms with the same programs, their cost and class selection can't be beat! Tammy at the front desk is really friendly and always helpful as is the whole staff! They really care about the kids and it shows in everything they do and in all the programs they offer. This summer (2013) we've had the opportunity and need to use the drop in day-camp and my kids really had a great time and look forward to every chance they get to attend the camp and really any other activities they offer. We also did a birthday party there for my youngest when he turned 5-he chose the gym- and all the families that attended had a great time and couldn't believe how much fun it was to have a party at a gym and what's more, the older kids (12-13 years old) in attendance had a blast too. My now 9 year old started with Coach Ed too, it was his choice and he really enjoyed Ed as his teacher. He's now on boys team and likes his new coaches Dave, Nalani and Kyle who always encourage and challenge him.

I wish they had a place like this in San Francisco where there are dueling pianos and drunken college folks who just sing along whether or not they know the lyrics.Cover was $6 I think but well worth it since the drinks are fairly inexpensive (from a city girl standard)...$6-7 roughly. You can request songs to the pianists but they'll really only get to your request if you throw in a few dollars for tip. One lady threw in $20 and her song was automatically played. She even got to sit up there with them. I would definitely come back to the Big Bang when I'm in town next. Bring a few friends, get a table in front (if possible) and enjoy the entertainment.","product_id":"6","review_rating":4}

First of all, good luck finding any eating whatsoever. Two pianos duke it out with classic songs and you can request songs with a tip. Don't think they only play cheesy showtunes. They do at times, and sometimes you can just sit there laughing at grown men belting out every word like they are own stage. Other times they drag unwilling people to stage and make them sing the words. All in all, a good time. Minus the Arizona heat.","product_id":"4","review_rating":3}

Definitely not the scene for people who weren't raised on classic rock. if all you love is R & B and the only songs you know by heart are rap, you're not going to like it here (as much as i do!!!).I'm always stoked to come here and get to sing a little diddy about jack and diane, while together we lament the day the music died and have one last dance with mary jane until the midnight hour when we cried MORE MORE MORE! In the very end we'll put bread in their jars and say \"man, what are you doing here!\"The Big Bang is a huge hit, with the entertainment truly making this place. i've come in here by myself, with a large group of people and with just a significant other. it doesn't matter who i'm with, we're all in here to get great drinks and shout great classic memories along with the (VERY) talented pianists... who all also double as drummer and bassistsguitarists. I highly recommend this barrel-of-monkeys type entertainment. but beware! the language gets foul and we all get a little rowdy. and if you didn't understand my paragraph on what gets me so stoked about this place, you're not going to \"get\" why so many people love it here.","product_id":"5","review_rating":4}

They even have a JELLO shot girl now, you can get them with whip cream and everything!  Another great thing is family nights on sundays. My friends have a youngster or two and its always great to find places to take them.  It's so cute to see them rockin out to the pianos!

So when a friend said she is getting a group together on a Saturday to go check out the Shout House at Westgate I was all for it!We got to the Shout House about 7:30ish, and my friend who has been here before had reserved tables for the group and after been there for while a noticed that that is the way to go, the place fills up pretty quick and turns into standing room only.For me, it was a blast I love the look of a baby grand piano and to have 2 on stage next to each other, man that was hot, and to watch the guys fingers just fly over the keys, yea it was a good night for sure!But they have more than just piano playing going on, they even bust out with the guitar and beat some drums, and this amazing chick comes out and just plays her heart out on the violin, she was great, made playing the violin look cool, maybe I should have played that instead of the flute haha  They have good drink prices and even serve food, service was kind of slow, but she was handling a huge crowd, but I suspect that to be the same size crowd every weekend.The crowd had a great vibe, everyone smiling and singingshouting along. I am a music person so this place was for me, but if you don't like loud music or the neighbor next to you singing along as if she is Adele but really more like Sanjaya , or some impromptu dancing and shouting happening, then this might not be the place for you, but me it was a great time and I will be back!","product_id":"4","review_rating":3}

The wait staff were tremendous and actually let us in out of the cold a little before the restaurant opened.  We were there with an infant which tends to complicate things at most restaurants, but they were well set up and didn't give it a second thought.We tried the bacon and eggs mac and cheese as well as the eggs benedict.  The mac and cheese was made with about 4 kinds of cheese and topped with their homemade bacon (which is amazing) and two perfectly poached eggs.  It was heavy, but delicious.  The eggs benedict was also incredible.  Not too much hollandaise and homemade bacon instead of ham.  The kicker was a homemade biscuit for the base.  It all came together very nicely.Griffintown Cafe was very kid friendly with amazing food and excellent staff.

The dishes came out piping hot- a very important factor for a delicious breakfast.  We ate at the bar and we spent a couple of hours lingering after our meal visiting with the staff, the chef and his wife.

The place is noisy, but that's just because it's one big space (including all the seating, the bar, and the kitchen) and popular. I don't find it a problem, but if you want a quiet spot to escape the noise, then you don't want to come here.While you're waiting for a table, try to squeeze in at the bar to order a coffee (it's really good here) - it makes the wait that much more bearable.The G Biscuit with bacon is my favourite savoury meal - it's not too big, super tasty, and cooked to perfection. On the sweet side I really like their french toast - nothing too crazy, just solid french toast goodness.Evening - much more chillaxed. I had the burger and pint Wednesday special for $18, and wasn't disappointed. The burger patty is a mix of beef, lamb, and duck, and tastes as good as it sounds! I can't remember what beer they have on tap, but it's good.","product_id":"1","review_rating":4}

Arriving starved after a morning train ride from Ottawa, I was seated on the terrasse. Snuggly wedged into my seat (which was also propping open the door to the restaurant) I got down to brass tacts: bennies and bevies. I ordered absolutely, positively correctly. The house cured wild salmon benny was a perfect blend of salty, sweet, pickled, and smoky flavour. And the mountain of potato mash with bites of onions I could have easily eaten double! Griffintown seems to be a restaurant that enjoys homemaking their wares. Much to my joyful surprise, they also had homemade ginger beer. And yes, it too was delicious.

The hummus was great (and free, thanks to a coupon that came in the mail) as was the warm pita bread. The hummus is a house recipe that is made on site. For dinner we got one of their boards and everything was great. It was a combination of your choices of meat, cheeses and bread that was of the highest quality and tasted fantastic. I also had the wine that was recommended by the waiter, which was a good fit.Gigino's is really a one of a kind place in Goodyear and hopefully they will be around for a long time.","product_id":"4","review_rating":4}

Everywhere you look it's big box stores and chains, and while many of the employees are lovely and personable, they're just not invested like they are in good old mom and pop shops. Enter Gigino's. Owned by a REAL DEAL Italian dude and his lovely wife, this place has some CRAZY good food. I'm fairly picky when it comes to my eats, so I don't say this lightly -- they made the BEST panini I've ever had in my life. Let me back up and set the stage for you a bit. I came here with my husband on his birthday, intending to have a glass of wine and some tapas -- the valpack coupon offering a free hummus drew me in. We entered this restaurantwine bar, which is nicely decorated and has a variety of fun different seating options (you can eat at the piano!!!), and were surprised to find it fairly empty on a Thursday evening. Happy hour was going on, so we enjoyed some $5 bruschetta, a glass of their house wine special for me, and a big craft beer for the birthday man. The Italian owner, whose name I can't recall, was very attentive and chatty without being overbearing, and when he found out it was my man's birthday, he proceeded to bring us two comp glasses of champagne. Nice! After enjoying our sips and snack, we decided to dive in to the paninis. We ordered two -- one with prosciutto, sun dried tomatoes, and a few other things I can't recall which was great, and one manchego cheese, some type of delicious meat, fig jam, and pears, grilled on sourdough that was out-freakin-standing. Oh. My. Goodness. Eat this right now. I savored every bite of this panini and told pretty much everyone I know and work with about it. For dessert, we had a pastry with nutella which was also tasty, but didn't compare to the panini. Overall, I'm a huge fan of this place. Great service, authentic people and food, AND locally owned. I sure hope they make it here, because I am looking forward to years of paninis. Mmm!","product_id":"5","review_rating":5}

If you have seen The Secret, read books by Louise Hay, or hopped on the Power of Now wagon, you understand the basic teachings of The Law of Attraction and changing your thinking, changes your life. Anyways, it is a perfect place to set aside an hour on Sunday to get back to basics. You can believe in any higher power and be cool here.

My first impression is that its such a beautiful church with symbols of various religious icons and a laid back atmosphere. The people seem to genuinely love it here and feel comfortable being in the presence of their pastor() Rev. Mitzi Lynton. She was well spoken, not pushy and not saying \"God this and Jesus that\". She told the congregation ,my family, to take a deep breath and say your own prayer for him as he was a father,husband, brother, grandfather, brother-in-law, father-in-law etc...you get the idea. I found that t o be super. They put up a few appetizers with water, tea and wine and gave our family room to mingle and greet eachother etc..The girls who helped were on top of everything!

Even though I didn't buy the yarn at their store, Chris helped me figure out the issue I was having and let me sit there for more than an hour while I took out my stitches and tried again. He's also helped walk me through what kind of yarn would be good for different products and even helped me fix a crochet afghan that was literally falling apart at the seams! Even though I know that I could find cheaper yarn online or at a big box store, I would never get the help, advice and great customer experience that Yarnhouse gives me!","product_id":"5","review_rating":3}

The season usually provides lots of variety, and the artistic standards are very high.  The Benedum itself is a magnificent venue to attend an opera, they have done a wonderful job restoring this historic building.  The acoustics of the Benedum are also really excellent.  The super titles are easy to read from just about any seat.  The orchestra is well rehearsed and play beautifully.

The first time at the center, I lived in NC and was attending a big work event here. I was very impressed by the architecture of the center but sadly wasn't in an area where I could see beautiful views of the city. After moving to Pittsburgh, I came for the annual home show and auto show. Though I liked both shows, the auto show was a bit more impressive. I hear that the home and garden show is a must-attend! Finally, I came here for the Boden liquidation sale yesterday. The views from the line to enter (where I sat for a looong time) were absolutely stunning! The section of the center overlooked the river and the North Shore with a bridge flanking both sides of the view. I didn't mind the wait just because I could admire the view. I look forward to coming back for the home and garden and auto shows in 2014!","product_id":"3","review_rating":5}

{"review_title":"My husband and I went to visit my nephew at Carnegie...","review_body":"My husband and I went to visit my nephew at Carnegie Mellon.  It was our first time in Pittsburgh, so we wanted something close to him.  The Shadyside Inn was PERFECT for our stay.  We are very, very, well traveled, and are extremely selective about where we stay.  I can say without a shadow of a doubt that we will be staying here again the next time we come back.  In fact we tried, but the dates we wanted were completely sold out :-(The location is perfect, and only a 5 minute walk from the shops and restaurants on Walnut Street.  You don't even need a car.  The Inn is a series of nicely renovated apartment buildings, so they are all equipped with well-stocked kitchens (my husband is a chef so he was very impressed by that).  The front desk person was sweet and friendly.  Not only did he check us in immediately, he gave us a \"breakfast bag\" full of muffins, juices, and granola bars!  Then he told us that he upgraded us to a suite, even tho we only booked a studio.   Well, when we got into our room, not only was it a suite, but it was a 2 BR suite!  I couldn't believe it.  It was bigger than our apartment back home.  Right then and there I wished we were staying longer - like a month!The suite had a giant flat screen TV, a big dining area, with room service menu, free wi-fi, and super comfy furniture.  The bed was to die for.  The only thing that didn't go was the older, un-renovated bathroom tiles & fixtures, but it really didn't bother us at all, because the shower water pressure was great.  There is ample parking out back, and the service people out taking care of the gardens and rooms were friendly and courteous.When we checked out, they were renovating the main office, so it's nice to see that they are constantly striving to update and improve.  Checkout took less than 30 seconds.  I handed her my key, and they told me they would email me a copy of my bill, since I used my credit card to book.  Everything went so smoothly, and the staff was so wonderful.  We LOVED our stay here and would come back in a heartbeat!","product_id":"7","review_rating":3}

Before leaving the lobby we were given a bag for a Sunday breakfast.  In the bag, bottle of orange juice, apple juice, two small muffins, two granola bars and mints.  The room we were put in look like a small  apartment.  Living roomdinning area and kitchen.  It also had two separate bedrooms, one was a single and the other was full.  This place was very clean and comfortable.This is my second time in Pittsburgh, the first time we stayed in a hotel, we had to pay for parking, go to an elevator to take us up to the lobby and take another elevator to get to our room and had to pay for WI-Fi.

{"review_title":"I hosted a bachelorette party for my sister at this...","review_body":"I hosted a bachelorette party for my sister at this location and overall everything was wonderful. There were a few customer service issues I had that I'd like to mention so that others are aware. 1- I booked the block of rooms 3 months in advance via the 1-800 number on the website. I have a military ID and requested the military discount. I was given the discounted rate for all 5 rooms and was told I only needed to present my ID upon arrival. Unfortunately, when I arrived the girl at the check-in counter told me that I could not have all 5 rooms at the discounted rate, that I could only have two of them. I pitched a royal fit and 40 minutes later they gave me all 5 rooms at the rate that I was quoted. Bad way to start a fun occasion.2- I emailed back and forth with Tracy Bernstein about specifics that I needed for this gathering I was hosting (iPod player, Microwave, Fridge, Early Check-in). I was told these things would be ready and they were not. We never got the iPod player, Microwave or Fridge. Bad customer service, Tracy.NOW, I'd like to tell you about the wonderful things at Holiday Inn City Center. 1- Very clean and modern. I loved the decor and it made great back drops for my photography.2- The rooms had adjoining doors which made it very easy for our guests to mingle.3- Jay Jay at the front desk was so friendly and helpful. He arranged a private limo service for us beautiful ladies for a great price. I've been told he has the \"hookup\" so make sure you get with him if you need anything special. 4- Adam is the food and beverage manager and he was so good to me. He offered to bring a 6 foot table in to our room with table cloths for FREE. Are you serious FREE He even came by the room to make sure we got all that I requested and warn us about the no noise policy starting at 11pm. We very happily toned it down by that point. The stay at the hotel was wonderful and the event was great. I really appreciate all that helped me at the hotel to make this event special!","product_id":"7","review_rating":5}
{"review_title":"I stayed at this particular holiday inn last week If you...","review_body":"I stayed at this particular holiday inn last week  If you check my previous reviews I always stay in a holiday inn or candlewood when I travel (IHG brand).  While 9 out of 10 are good experiences this one takes the cake.  Based on yelp reviews we knew ahead of time about the parking fee (it is unavoidable in the center of the city)At least it is only a 1 time fee and they validate it for your stay.  After parking we go to hotel lobby to check in and were greeted by a very nice and helpful receptionist (I wish I remembered her name).  She told us that we had the best room in the entire hotel, and I truly believe it. Our room was 15th floor room 1534.  It was on the corner so we got 2 walls of windows, one side had a great view of uptown (not the arena which is behind the hotel), and the ceilings were over 12 feet high. Our king bed was comfy as always, and I always fall asleep quickly on them.The hotel itself is furnished in a contemporary style, and will appeal to 9 out of 10 people.  It is located one block from the Epicenter, and only a block or two from the lightrail system for easy commuting.    The one time we had to leave parking was to travel about 3.5 miles to go to an auditorium (we saw Wicked, and it was fantastic).  Other than that there was no reason to drive anywhere since you are close to everything in uptown.  In the beginning of my post I said that my boyfriend and myself always stay in a variety of the Holiday Inn brand hotels.  For anybody looking into hotels, I suggest you sign up for their rewards system, whether or be this one (priority club) or another chains version of it.  Hotels reward loyalty, and will do a lot to keep you loyal.  We did our research and liked the IHG brand (everything from Holiday inn express to Intercontinental)for a few reasons; they are literally everywhere so we knew that when we travel we can stay with them and continue earning points, and price-wise they stay competitive.  Our room preferences are already saved to our account (free to create).  So as a tip to everybody do a little research into hotels rewards programs, then stick to it.  If you stay with a hotel chain ten times a year, they will do a little more to keep you happy, and make up for any bad experiences you might have along the way. When I first started out with my Priority Club membership I highly doubt they would have upgraded me to the 15th floor with some of best views in the whole hotel, but because of my loyalty to them they rewarded me (at no additional cost).  The room was only $97, and that really can't be beat  for this location.","product_id":"5","review_rating":4}

{"review_title":"Probably not one of my more timely reviews...St. Mary's...","review_body":"Probably not one of my more timely reviews...St. Mary's apparently began its life as the chapel of an orphanage (which itself is no longer standing).  Now it is just the chapel, which is used for weddings - I suppose other events could take place there as well, but weddings are far and away the most popular event at the chapel.Take note of that if you plan to get married there (as we did).  We went in late January and they were booked through August.  This means that every possible slot was filled - in two-hour increments - more than seven months in advance.  In other words, plan ahead.As luck would have it, browsing one page at a time, we managed to find a single slot that had been canceled, so we grabbed it, and that lone factor is what sealed our wedding date (a mere two months from our engagement date, rather less than that from the time we went to find a venue).  But we are very glad it did, because the location itself rocks.Nestled just outside the 277 loop, on the grounds of Thompson Park (also the site of the Vietnam Veterans memorial), the chapel and the park offers a nice respite from the busy-ness of Uptown while being close to everything.  The trees provide great cover, so you barely know you are so close to the city, and inside it is like you have stepped back in time.  You can even have your organist play a harpsichord (if they are able).Since our wedding party was intimate - just the immediate family - we had the whole group entirely on the raised dais, which provided a nice treat to everyone, rather than scattering them in the pews, which would have separated everyone far too much (for larger parties, it would certainly be fine).

My boyfriend and I just went for Valentine's Day. Had a reservation, got there a little early, and were still seated immediately, and in the jazz room too! (Side note: the female singer they had on Valentine's was INCREDIBLE. Wish I got her name) My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVE the rolls they give everyone, possibly the best rolls I've had at any restaurant. For my drink, I ordered the chocolate martini, my favorite! Oh, and of course a Hurricane later, also deliciousFor my entree I had the special Tilapia with the crawfish topping. OH! First, let me mention, the gumbo that comes before the entree is AMAZING. I don't care if it's not authentic! Who cares about authenticity when the food is THAT good. I ate that gumbo so fast my boyfriend was making comments like, \"Slow down, it's not going anywhere!\" It had a little bit of a kick to it, which I don't normally like, but the flavor was just too good! Now, back to the entree. Last time, I ordered the same thing, but I didn't even try the crawfish topping; I just gave it all to my mom. This time, however, I realized what a mistake that was! I've actually never had crawfish before, so I have nothing to compare theirs to, but it was delicious, and I'm already craving more! The tilapia, like the first time, was also to-die-for. I will admit I'm biased because I like tilapia pretty much anywhere I go as long as they cook it right, but my boyfriend seemed to like it as well. He also loved his salmon special with the shrimp topping (as did I!).Unfortunately, neither of us were able to leave room for dessert, so I have nothing to say about that. Overall, this place is definitely in my top 3 restaurants in Charlotte now. The only problem is the parking, which is almost unavoidable whenever you go there. It's such a tiny place with barely any parking, but I'd rather deal with the parking than have them move to another location. The tiny old building, along with the jazz music playing, makes me feel like I've gone back in time. It's such a cozy, romantic restaurant. Definitely a great choice for Valentine's Day, and even my extremely picky, high-maintenance boyfriend (I love him, but he is!) agreed. Believe me, he wasn't lying. He wouldn't hesitate to tell me if I picked a bad restaurant! lol.","product_id":"7","review_rating":5}

A crappy venue can kill a good artist and put up a good fight against a great one.Fortunately, The Rhythm Room needn't worry about quashing the entertainment value of one of their nationally touring acts.  And the RR really does get some of the best independent acts on tour.  For artists worthy of smallish venues, this place should be as legendary as the Whiskey in Hollywood, but unfortunately, its located on, like the kiddie ride portion of Los Angeles, central Phoenix.For a venue, they have really smokin deals on alcohol, like PBR for $2.50.  Considering that you couldn't get that deal ANYWHERE playing live music, i consider it a humongous bargain.  They have a smoking patio that you can still hear the music during those 5 mins, and the venue is easy to get in and out of.It DOES tend to get crowded once the main act is on, especially near the bar, but I've never waited more than a couple of minutes for a drink and i can always find a good view of the stage.When acts like Bob Schneider come around, the place is ROWDY.  Indie acts like VHS or Beta and Midlake are near priceless to see in such a small joint.and sometimes shows that pique too much interest will be moved to their big cousin Marquee.","product_id":"4","review_rating":3}

It kinda reminds me of the Foothill (R.I.P.) in Long Beach, CA. And that's a good thing.

You rarely see such an eclectic mix of people, from every color of the rainbow, and all ages, just enjoying the music.

The RR is also really good about showcasing newer bands from all over the country of all genres. The drinks are cheap, the bartenders are awesome and always show ample cleavage. The crowd on any given night ranges from the young hipsters to the AARP crowd who still dress up for a night on the town with cocktails and dancing. There is no pretension here.

I always felt sort of exposed the way the seating was. There is that long row of bar stools that makes you feel on display. Now I prefer listening to music rather than dancing to it (except at home where I often break into dance for no reason whatsoever.) So now I say I love you Rhythm Room. You make me feel like Goldilocks except without the long walk in the woods and home burglary part. You are not to hot, not to cold, you are just right. Not to big, not to small, again... you got it right. And I haven't even broken a bar stool yet. Nor have I fallen asleep while at the Rhythm Room. I am done with the young hip scene I use to visit at the Emerald Lounge, before it was turned into a Starbucks. If I go someplace like that now it always seems too loud and my personal space always feels violated. I still feel to young for the lounge act at Scottsdale's blahblahblah so where do I fit in Where do I fit in Where can I go for good music and not stand out like a, well, just not stand out. I dislike big crowds and arenas. Small venues are fine if you are not the only audience member and will be missed if you need to get up to pee.  The beer is cold but my friends who prefer a gin and tonic can also be taken care of. The people who work there are nice, no attitude, and are actually very cool. If it gets a little crowded or if you feel like chatting someone up they have a patio. Finally I have found a place where I can blend in and listen to the music I love. Bowerbirds, check. St. Vincent, check. Now, if you could just book Grizzly Bear it would be true love and I would live happily ever after.","product_id":"9","review_rating":4}

What a warm welcome right off the bat.It was a little hard to find, but once you find it, you will be so glad you did.  Their food is amazing!  I have been twice now and have had their pork chops, hot links, and chicken wings, all were perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, and tasted excellent!  I was a bit hesitant with the hot links, as often they come way too greasy for my taste, but these were grilled to perfection and not overly greasy.  I was very impressed.  I have also tried their dirty rice (spicy and dirty with ground beef, great!), black eyed peas, and their french fries.  The fries were just fries, but seasoned well.... everything else was spot on.  I really enjoyed their dirty rice.  I've had a lot of different types of dirty rice, and this was very unique and very tasty.Their chicken deserves its own paragraph here.  Seriously.  I order their fried chicken \"not battered\", so they basically season the chicken and drop it in the deep fryer.  OMFG.  I've eaten my share of fried chicken, but their chicken, by far, is better than anything I have ever eaten..... easy.  In fact, my mouth is literally watering as I type this.  Go, eat their chicken. The environment was nice... low light, dark decor, great old school tunes being spun by a dj on the 1's and 2's.

It had this slight crunchiness on the outside that was like little heavenly crunchy bits. The fried chicken beat the pants off of any other soul food restaurant I've been to.

I found out about it through a friend who pointed it out to me when I first arrived in town. He told me David Lynch famously said this is the \"best bar in Madison.\" What's most awesome about Le Tigre are the bartenders. The owner has owned three iterations of the bar since the 50s, and his son bartends most of the time. His son is one of the nicest, most genial, and quickest bartenders you'll find in town. The bar attracts many locals and regulars who come in just to talk with him. This is another place you can feel safe coming to if you feel like having a drink on your own (and as a woman, it can be difficult to find such places).I don't want to ruin the suprise of Le Tigre's decor too much, but if you are a lover of kitsch, you'll love Le Tigre. The bar also has a jukebox filled with songs that have been in it since the owner opened the bar in another location in the 50s. Some notes: you can't swear in the bar. If you have a potty mouth and need to exercise it, go to another bar. Le Tigre also is cash-only, and there is no ATM, because the owner doesn't feel safe having one, so if you forget cash, you've got a bit of a haul to an ATM. Also, don't expect draught beers; you can only get beer in bottles here, though there is also a full bar.This is a local's bar, an oddity, a place you go to for a kick.

The bartender was friendly, the atmosphere cozy, and the music classic.  Drinks were good and cheap.  A decently sized (and poured) Tanqueray and tonic and a Spotted Cow will set you back $8.  Other than the free flowing popcorn there's no food, no credit cards, and allegedly no swearing, though I did manage to catch myself saying \"ass\" and I didn't even notice I'd said \"bitchass bitch\" and nobody tossed me out on my can.

My husband and I have been wanting to go here for a long time, mostly because of the camp factor. It seemed really cheesy and fun. Turns out, it is AMAZING. Here is the low-down of why I love this place. Atmosphere - Outside of the very obvious and corny tiger decor, this is the kind of place you could come to in a cocktail dress or jeans and a t-shirt and fit in (I know because we saw that exact combination while we were there). If you stay for more than a few drinks, you might forget where you are or what time of day it is because it is quite dark inside. Other than than, it is a standard townie bar dressed to the nines, complete with obligatory free, stale popcorn. There is ample parking, but you might not want to drive (see Drinks)Drinks - I got a Tom Collins. My husband got a Manhattan. These are the types of drinks you should order at this place. They make a fabulous, no frills, strong mixed drink. As it should be. This is Wisconsin, after all.Staff - I've only ever been there when a younger man was bartending, but he was fabulous. He was chatty and friendly without being annoying. And he had a sense of humor about his white shirt and bow tie. Take home - Le Tigre is not only special because of it's camp and decor. It is fabulous because they put some crimson lipsick on tired, old hole in the wall and made her look like Scarlet Johansson.","product_id":"3","review_rating":3}

The restaraunt is situated on the top floor of the Phoenician Resort and every seat at Mary Elaine's has a spectacular view of the valley.We let the chef prepare a tasting menu for us, and their Sommelier (wine expert) paired wines with many of the tastings.

I may be the last; Mary Elaine's closes its doors for good sometime this month (Feb 2008). Perhaps I am the second person because a proper dinner for two (and I mean that that includes a _real_ selection from the best wine list in the city) will cost you $700 to $800, easily the cost of a coach ticket to Paris for the real thing. But make your reservations in advance. Dinner at Guy Savoy must be planned 4 to 6 weeks ahead. In case you don't realize it by the time you finish this one, I _AM_ a food snob.I feel a very heavy burden here because Mary Elaine's has stood for everything I have hoped for in the finest of service and detailed preparation in a dining experience since I was a member of the Plaza Club, also now defunct. That I could presume to review this establishment and the professionals who take each and every part of their job as their personal quest in life is totally ludicrous. Instead of a review, I can at best present some of my fondest memories of this wonderful place. OK, Now that I have set the bar high enough for myself, let me begin.]I can't remember if the team that comprises the army of staff that will serve you at front of house numbers 12 or 21 people, but by the time your dinner is over, you will have had a dinner to remember for the rest of your life.Take your pick from one of two seatings, 6 to 6:45 or 8:30 to 9:15. Give the reservationist every last detail of your preferences. Some of my favorite requests: (1) seat me as far away from that wailing wanna-be Lisa Addeo who thinks she can replace Nancy Gee -- she's still singing the exact same songs in the exact same order she was eight years ago in the lobby. If I have to hear her make those Time-to-Say-Goodbye octave leaps one more effing time, I'm going to kill myself; (2) give us relaxed timing on the courses, we're in no rush; (3) my guest does not drink alcohol and is from Iran, find a formal drink for her that she will appreciate; (4) my guest loves Chateaubriand, could you scrape some upAmong my most memorable experiences:The time Todd (manager) knowing my love of late 80's California cabs found a bottle of '88 Heitz Martha's Vineyard and surprised me for my birthday dinner.The time my guest surprised me by calling in and requested hot sourdough for my bread choice knowing how much I love it.The time our party sat at Chef's table in the kitchen and I watched first hand the quietest kitchen you can possibly imagine.The bottle of '62 Chateau Gran Larose that left my mouth black and from which I was still drunk the next day.My one and only ever sliver of Louis XIV cognac at $750 a slice.The way Nancy Gee used to sing Angel Eyes, my favorite.The time Sommelier Paul introduced me to the rasiney sweet pleasure of Lusteau Emilin cherry.Mary Elaine's took pride in finding the most extravagant yet excellent ingredients in the entire world. It would not be uncommon for the special to include some extremely rare fish that had been flown in that afternoon. The wine list boasted 5000 bottles. Where else could you splurge on a $10,000 bottle of champagne (The answer is Etienne's Different Point of View at Pointe Tapatillo Cliffs.) What if you feel like having a '60's bottle of Lafite Rothschild Paul and his staff were always happy to oblige.I'm talking about the subtleties of food preparation such that a single course may have but six or seven bites, but each of those is a symphony of tastes that overwhelms the senses. On my last visit, the sauce chefs had perfected their entries to each course to such an extent that their excellence sometimes overshadowed the main ingredients themselves.It was fun to gulp my entire glass of water to see how many seconds it would take to be noticed and refilled (no more than 15).Mary Elaine's celebrated what might be called a sacred relationship between a host and his guest.

I thought perhaps one final blow-out on April 5th would have been a wonderful way to bid an appropriate farewell to a grand lady.Formal, elegant dining is clearly on the wane, and while there are many excellent restaurants in the greater Phoenix-Scottsdale area, Mary Elaine's will always stand alone. It will be missed.","product_id":"2","review_rating":3}

It's not really our style, but we had a great time, nonetheless. The service was, of course, very good. I thought it would be too stuffy for our tastes and that I'd feel out of place, but this did not happen. As a matter of fact, after our server warmed up to us, we had a great back-and-forth... same goes for our backserver, who we came to call the Bread-Pusher, because the bread is incredibly addicting.I had the tasting menu, and other than the rabbit, it was awesome. I didn't like the rabbit not because of how it was prepared though, I just don't like rabbit. Too cute and fuzzy.Our server brought us some great wine pairings that were not on the menu and included what we dubbed the \"adult\" framboise... so delicious. It was a cherry sparkling wine  and tasted amazing with chocolate.The whole night was opulence perfected. I will probably never eat here again (oh, except for that whole gift certificate thing) especially because it's closing, but it was fantastic and really a wonderful place to take someone if you need to either impress them or if you're apologizing for something you really, really screwed up.","product_id":"7","review_rating":4}

It is a super nice french restaurant in Phoenician Resort. My first fancy french dining experience! :) All four of us had the tasting menu that evening with great Ridge wine. The tasting mene has small portion but amazing food. As expected, it took us ~4 hours to get done with the dinner. It was the only drawback J could come up with... I think that was perfectly fine for me since we are dining in a FRENCH restaurant. Just enjoy the process! I would definitely go there again.","product_id":"5","review_rating":5}

By the time we found Jardin Nelson we were hungry and getting punchy. I looked to the back and saw the outdoor patio and large canvas coverings and said \"oooohh, let's go here!\" We were led to a quaint table at the back, a jazz band playing lovely music. The greenery and flowers hang all over the place and the whole atmosphere is warm and inviting. Our server was super nice, friendly, and courteous.I got the leek soup special. It was creamy, savory, a perfect soup. I got the veggie crepe for dinner and gobbled every bit. It was so delicious. For dessert we had the cheesecake crepe and it was heaven. You have to get this thing. Topped with graham crackers and strawberries, totally decadent.Exquisite dining experience from top to bottom. Would return anytime and recommend to anyone.","product_id":"6","review_rating":3}

We sat outside in the garden (after a 10 minute wait for a  late dinner on a Friday night) and marveled at the design of the place. The giant, umbrella-like contraptions probably allow for outdoor seating when it rains and made you feel like you were sitting under giant flowers. The south wall and the foliage definitely made us feel like we were in a garden. The sounds of a jazz quartet wafting through a fresh summer night definitely capped a most romantic evening.Now the food: we started with the Estivale salad (intricately prepared mixing refreshing fruit and vegetables together in perfect balance - one of the best salads we've ever had) and for our main course, had the charcutiere pizza and the saddle of rabbit crepe. The pizza was amazing - thin crust with the tastiest meats on there! The crepe was also very tasty but difficult to isolate all ingredients within (no big deal).For dessert, we shared the pouding chomeur and omg was it incredible. It was very sweet (because of the high quality pure maple syrup) and the vanilla ice cream balanced that perfectly.One of the things I really liked seeing was that on the comment card, there was a question for rating pricequality ratio. Indeed, this place had an excellent pricequality ratio! They could easily charge more, for the setting, for the jazz, for the food but they don't. Very respectable!For a perfect romantic summer evening, this is it! Highly recommended. We would totally go back.","product_id":"8","review_rating":3}

There is a patio situated right onto Place Jacques Cartier, however there is an open section behind the restaurant, where a jazz quartet was playing.  The food was really good.  My wife had a crepe, my sister also had a crepe (not the same kind of course), while I enjoyed an \"Italian\" pizza, which I know as a Margarita pizza.  We absolutely loved the atmosphere and sitting outside on a hot and humid Montreal evening, drinking wine, listening to live jazz  and eating great French food made this a real highlight of our trip.","product_id":"6","review_rating":3}

We sat in the back garden, and we were instantly cooled by the shade and breeze the architecture of the inner eaterie. It's beautiful, with lots of garden plants and stone walls, well lit and your meal is accompanied by jazz music (sometimes live as when I went!).The waitresses are cute and friendly, and can obv accommodate if you only speak english. The menu is somewhat sparse, but what's on there is made with a delicate and professional touch; all of our food was top notch and delicious. I had the house crepe, a friend had the rabbit and another the scallopene. We relaxed and enjoyed the meal and the scenery and heartily recommend the jardin Nelson to both tourists and locals alike. Prices are btwn $15-25person.","product_id":"4","review_rating":3}

Rain funnels down the sails into large glass columns. Hard to explain, but VERY cool. Food was above average, but set amidst all of the tourist attraction area, it's more than what you'd expect.

Even if the food had been terrible, the scenic brick courtyard with its lush, flowering planters, live jazz band, and oversized umbrellas would've made the dining experience memorable. But luckily, the dinner was great too!We tried the brie, pesto, and pine nut fondue as an appetizer, which was served with toasted baguette slices and a bunch of grapes, and which met with enthusiastic reviews from our cheese-loving crowd. A smorgasbord of the signature crepe dinners followed - we sampled the mushroom-filled Forestiere, the vegetable and goat cheese, the apple-bacon, and the duck. At about $15-$20 a plate, we didn't find the cost incongruous with the food quality. For dessert, we sampled the \"pudding chomeur,\" a Quebec favorite that features some sort of spongey, sweet base soaked in maple syrup and served with a side of vanilla ice cream - also delicious, though we were too stuffed to finish the modest portion, even between the four of us!The service was equally pleasant; we arrived around 9:30pm on a Saturday night and were seated within ten minutes. Our dry-witted French waiter was a delight, suggesting that a hungry member of our party \"start with one crepe, and then if you're really still hungry I may bring you another,\" and later threatened to deny me dessert for not finishing my main course. English menus are printed on the reverse of the French, for visiting anglophones. Overall - great decor, food, ambiance, and service. We'll be returning if we're ever in Old Town Montreal again!","product_id":"10","review_rating":3}

A beautiful courtyard patio with canopies and, trees and flowers and a jazz combo played in the not so background.We shared the nachos ($15) for starters and they were very yummy and cheesy.  My father kept commenting on the cranberry salsa.  My mother started with the French Onion Soup and said it was the best she had ever had. I had the UnBeetable salad and found it filling and delicious. I also ordered a 16 oz pitcher of White Sangria.  It was GREAT!  So yummy on a warm afternoon and great to share with a friend.My 3-year-old was nicely welcomed and given crayons and a paper.

It was heavenly! The crepe batter is much thicker than the expected paper-thin variety, but it definitely works. It's still light and soft, and the hint of sweetness works so well with the salty bacon and savoury cheese and eggs.

{"review_title":"Upstairs is Montreal's finest jazz venue and one of the...","review_body":"Upstairs is Montreal's finest jazz venue and one of the city's local gems. Its a small and intimate, a perfect spot for any date and a fun way to spend an evening sipping on drinks, grabbing a bite, and listening to some of the best live music in the area.  Joel Giberovitch opened this neat little jazz joint nearly 20 years ago, which has gained a notable amount of popularity, especially in the last decade. His inspirations from his past  trips to legendary New York jazz are an obvious influence in the makeup of his decor, which include wooden panels, brick walls, a lengthy yet cozy bar, and classy linens draping each table. If that doesn't establish the mood, I don't know what does. Seating is tight of course, but group dining is very possible here; I would highly recommend reservations.Though it's been touted as a fun lunch spot, I'm more of a fan during their showcase nights which happen every Friday and Saturday. There is usually a cover charge before midnight, which was about $5 last time I checked. Groups of 4 or more are almost guaranteed a wait, but if you don't listen to jazz often, then take it like a champ and wait it out.If the music isn't worth it (but of course it is), then consider the food and the drinks. Much of the menu is distinctly American, with quite few dishes named after notable states in the South, the birth place of jazz. Another portion of the menu is tapas, which is more bar food (nachos, quesadillas, fries, etc.) than they are classic Spanish small plates. I've enjoyed their food overall, as I've had good results with their pappardelle verona, their New Orleans filet mignon, and their array of tasty burgers. Try any of their martinis or get a wine to be paired with the food.Then of course there's the music. Live jazz doesn't have to be during Montreal Jazz Festival, it can be had here on a much more casual level. The music has always taken precedence and has been a treat every time. I could probably not even eat anything and just sit to enjoy the performances, which vary from a wide range of local and visiting musicians.I think very highly of this place and hope it continues to do well. I haven't gone to Montreal as often lately and want Upstairs to keep the drinks flowing and the music going. If only I could write their name upside down (see pics for reference).","product_id":"3","review_rating":4}

I can't complain about the food: Lots of tasty tapas (the Ceviche, Prosciutto, and Gambas are must-tries), a great Scotch selection, and of course, local beers. If you get there while an act has already started their set, sit outside if it's not too cold.

Since Montreal has possibly one of the best jazz scenes in the world, that's high praise.  I can see why.While the music may not always be jazz, the club is a great venue.  Its small and intimate, with good acoustics.  Make sure you check the calendar, as the bands can be eclectic.  And you may want to make reservations.  Finally, expect a cover charge ($11 and well worth it).The doorman was great.  There wasn't any more room for a show and, instead of simply telling us to beat feet as many would, he recommended a later show and reservations in the future.  We came back for the later show and he seated us at the side bar.  After the set, he seated us (party of two) in a booth for the late set.

Nikki came along and was extremely knowledgeable with my textured type of hair; she had an amazing attitude not only to satisfy the customer but also towards the not so experienced stylist, they are lucky to have her as a mentor. I don't usually write reviews but after the experience I had at that salon I think it's worth writing a review to mention the professionalism and the positive attitude of the salon. I did mention to Nikki this is probably the first time I've ever had anyone \"understand\" my hair. She didn't take forever to blow dry my hair because she knew what she was doing.

I was looking for a place that specified with skin care. I didn't want to go somewhere and spend a hundred dollars on someone rubbing and massaging products into my face for a hour. I wanted to come out with some results to my skin problems. Sharon did everything I wanted in a facial PLUS more! Their business is skin and it started out with Sharon's mother Hannah and now Sharon is in the business. Its a nice quaint place. Not as grand and opulent as the franchise spas but nice and cozy. Sharon explained a lot of things to me so I could understand what she was doing while she was doing it but not too talkative where I was unable to relax. She started out with explaining her background and than moving onto my skin needs and what she recommends for my facial. She took her time doing everything. SHe was so thorough with her massages and extractions, I LOVED it! What I didn't expect and have never received anywhere else was a foot massage while my face was getting a peel and steam bath! I usually get a hand or shoulder massage but never a foot massage. She massaged each foot and put them into little warm booties. I was in my little own world while she was working on my face. I did not feel rushed I felt like she had all the time in the world to work on my face pore by pore! I loved it and recommend it to anyone who needs skin care!","product_id":"1","review_rating":4}

I didn't know anything about her and I was nervous because my hair is kind of my \"thing.\"  And if you get a bad haircut, you have to wait to make it better.Well turns out Myra was great, a really sweet girl and she knows what she is doing.  That first time there I was coloring my hair dark brown and I discussed with her what would I have to do to get back to my natural dirty blonde color when I got sick of being a brunette.  She explained what we would need to do and a little over a year later we started on the process to bring it back to blonde.  It was definitely cheaper to just get cut and color then the highlights and cut, but she does such a good job and I always get a lot of compliments.  And I can let it go for longer in between touch ups.  Also of note, my first time here the receptionist didn't let Myra know I had checked in and so there was a bit of a misunderstanding and I was left to sit for a while.  I approached the desk again after waiting 20 minutes and told them I had a flight to catch in 3 hours, would we be able to start soon, if not I had to leave.Well Myra was so apologetic and she felt awful that they kept me waiting.  I did get out of there a bit later than I would have liked, and I did find myself running to get into the airport, but I did make my flight.  But the best thing was, I got a gift certificate in the mail soon after for either a free massage, pedicure or facial with any other service I had.  I thought that was a really nice touch and I used it for a pedicure after a haircut on another visit.","product_id":"6","review_rating":3}

One of the worst things about moving is having to find a new stylist. Before I moved to Charlotte, I had my stylist do an all-over color to bring me back to my original hair color and wipe out my years of highlights so I didn't have to find someone right away after moving for upkeep. After a year and a half, I finally decided to brave the daunting task of finding a new salon so I could be back to my blonde alter ego. Girls in my office had been recommending Modern for months, but I decided to take my chances elsewhere. Bad choice. After 3 sub-par highlights, I looked like a tiger (in a bad, orange and streaky kind of way) and gave in to their insistence that I try Modern. Man, do I feel silly that I wasted so much time and money at other salons! Sandy, a stylist at Modern, was not only one of the nicest people I've ever met, but she did an outstanding job on my hair. She understood exactly what I relayed to her and went above and beyond in doing a deep conditioning treatment and explaining what we could do next time to make my hair look even better. Sandy is a true professional and really listened to what I was saying about how my hair reacts to different things and they way I like it to look (unlike the other places I had gone, hence the tiger-head.) After a wonderful head massage during the deep conditioning treatment and a fantastic blow-out, i was on my way to face the world looking 100% better than when I walked in. I would recommend Sandy's services to anyone who wants to look fabulous.","product_id":"5","review_rating":5}

Since moving to WI, I made myself home at MCV and have a regular hairdresser who makes my life easier and less stressful. Every four weeks for a trim.

I mentioned this to the poised woman at the check-in desk who said that next time I should park in the lot at their building where they validated parking. She then brough out a yummy iced tea for me to sip while filling out the new client form. I went to the bathroom, which featured a delightful scented candle, and then Sandy () brought me to the changing room and then my chair. A surprise: shortly after sitting down in the barber chair a woman brought me over to have my shampoo--and gave me a brief massage first. The massageshampoo woman had a very positive energy to her. Marina cut my hair and, although she was not much of a talker, was upbeat and gave me a great cut. I've been looking for a great place in Phoenix and found it.

As someone who chooses to invest his hard earned money on an item, it gives me relief to know Snail will always provide quality service, care, and most of all, GREAT customer service!To speak briefly about comparison, I've since had experience with other local coating shops. Although the quality and care of the work done elsewhere was sufficient, I will continue to use Snail's services when I need quality work done correctly the first time. Thanks Snail! Keep up the great work!","product_id":"3","review_rating":3}
{"review_title":"We have gone with Snail Motorsports for so many things,...","review_body":"We have gone with Snail Motorsports for so many things, since Juan started in his garage, doing small jobs.  He has powder coated an antique medicine cabinet, several sets of wheels, several parts for my Jeep, media blasted a ton of our chairs for our business...that ton equals out to around 300.  When he tells you when he will have your items ready, he is right there with it when he promises.  You can find him in his shop way into the late hours...just to get your item completed.  You will never find anyone more Type A about his finished product than Juan.  We have never been disappointed in any item or any quote we have received.  He does all of his own media blasting and powder coating...he doesn't farm them out to other contractors.  He service is top notch and I would recommend Snail Motorsports to everyone.  Thank you Juan and the Snail Motorsports team.","product_id":"8","review_rating":4}

At first I was really scared because I was getting $2k rims (Advan TCIII) and almost $3k worth of parts under the hood. Juan exceeded my expectations! They came out perfect. With the amount of work, time, and effort he put into them I'm surprised he didn't charge me more. He gave me an awesome deal! A few months later I brought a set of cheaper wheels (used set of enkei rpf1) and a few suspension parts to get coated and the work was just as phenomenal! Juan treated $800 worth of parts just as he would $5k worth of parts. I wouldn't trust anyone else with powder coating my car parts. I will always support quality work and that is why I will always be a customer of Juan and Snail Motorsports.","product_id":"3","review_rating":4}

It's very special to me, and I wouldn't trust any part of it to just anyone.My first contact with Snail Motorsports was via email, and Juan answered all my questions quickly and thoroughly.  Very clear on pricing and time to completion.  I took the wheels in, selected my color and went home to wait.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive a link to photos of my wheels after media blasting and at completion.  The work was done on-time and the whole process was very professional.  I couldn't be happier. Now, 2 years later, they look as good as the day I picked them up.You can't go wrong with Snail Motorsports for powdercoating!","product_id":"5","review_rating":3}

{"review_title":"I am a huge fan of Sushi Three. They live within walking...","review_body":"I am a huge fan of Sushi Three. They live within walking distance of my home, so it's no problem getting here and the temptation for sushi is always in the back of my mind! Admittedly, the price of the food here tends to keep my cravings in check for a couple months at a time, but when I do come here, I enjoy every bite. Occasionally I also order take-out since they have very reasonable lunch deals, but really, I prefer to sit and eat at the restaurant itself.Speaking of: the place itself is very quiet, which I actually like; I can just sit, talk with a friend or read a book, and then (what a radical concept) enjoy my food in peace. This is a big deal for me because the other places I know of where I can get sushi are loud, busy, and quite frankly, a little limiting options-wise compared to Sushi Three's menu. If I want sushi, I either come here or I get a small pack at Giant Eagle. That's how much I hate the other sushi places I've visited in Pittsburgh. If I'm going to pay as much as I do for my fish, I want to be in a place I can sit and actually enjoy my food.By the way, Sushi Three does serve things other than sushi, so people looking for some Japanese food that isn't rice and fish are definitely going to find something. There's some really delicious beef, chicken and pork dishes. But of course, a place with the word \"sushi\" in its name is going to specialize in sushi, and there are pages and pages of sushi options available here. The orders come in various styles and sizes as well, so couples can get something to share or just get something smaller for themselves. The combos all come with soup and salad, which are also very yummy.I at this point have developed a routine order: a large salad and an order of softshell crab rolls are all I need here. Sure, I'll occasionally snag a bite from someone here with me, but the truth is that Sushi Three makes such enormous orders that I can't eat more than that without feeling a bit sick. But hey, at least you get your money's worth! I say definitely give this place a shot if you're a sushi fan.","product_id":"6","review_rating":4}

We had to wait at the bar even after making reservation, but thats OK. At the table we were not rushed at all. The food was tasty and the chef was funny and interesting.

He had been some years back before, and this was my first time. Getting to the actual restaurant was a bit weird because of how you have to navigate the mountain (I don't know, is that considered a mountain, or is it a hill Being from the south everything that makes me lift my legsfeet higher is a mountain). It was rather empty as it was only like 11.30AM, but that was ok with us as we're not a big fan of people (joke ... maybe). The interior is ridiculously awesome, especially the raised bar.Our chef walks up and it's a white man, which was a definite first for me at a Japanese steakhouse. And he seemed out of it. During the course of the meal, he did inform us that he was hungover ... it's Labor Day, what're gonna do It didn't bother me too much, but I think he did annoy the hell out of my boyfriend lol. He told some good albeit corny jokes, did the usual tricks plus a few new ones - he was overall entertaining.The food: oh man, was it yummy. I got the soba noodles and beef julienne. The noodles were cooked in some type of sauce that I couldn't describe, but they were the best soba noodles I have ever had. The beef julienne was also super delicious. The sauce on it was described as a teriyaki sauce, but it didn't taste like it at all to me, which was fine with me because I'm not a big teriyaki fan. After eating we hit the bar and had drink apiece. The bartender was really cool and the bar area had a great vibe and atmosphere. Sure, Japanese Steakhouses are pricey, but this is one of the few I've been to that is more than worth it.","product_id":"4","review_rating":3}

We love hibachi restaurants and go to various area restaurants on a regular basis.  Benihana is the oldest of the hibachi restaurants in the area, so we had not been for a while.  We arrived early before the rest of our party and the staff was very welcoming.  They would regularly stop by and make sure we didnt need anything.  After our party arrived, we were seated and our chef came out. He was very entertaining and the food tasted amazing.  The best part was how accommodating the staff was.  One member of our party had a food allergy and the manager specifically came over to ensure that all food would be made in the back and would not come in contact with other ingredients.We had our 2 year old daughter with us and part way through the meal she started squirming and wanted to walk around the restaurant.  After a few \"laps\" of the restaurant, without us asking, the manager came out with crayons and paper which made our daughter VERY happy.  Everyone was so pleasant and the food was better than I had remembered.  Benihana has a lot of competition from Saga, Nakama and others, but after our most recent visit, Benihana definitely has the best value and the best staff.  We visited Saga shortly after going to Benihana and just kept commenting on how much better Benihaha was.","product_id":"3","review_rating":4}

I'm from NYC, so it's not that my palate is easy to satisfy. I just really think that Pittsburgh has great restaurants with authentic, and tasty foods. I am a serious advocate of dining in Pittsburgh, and I take pride in knowing the good places to eat. There, those are my self-proclaimed credentials. So take this to heart: Andy's Sushi Bar (located in Wholey's) is probably the 1 place to get sushirolls in Pittsburgh. Now, a few caveats: it is NOT a restaurant, it is a stand inside Wholey's supermarket that does take-out orders ONLY. You will NOT get a dining experience, so for those of you who want to go to a nice japanese restaurant for dinner, you are not in luck. This sushi stand is only open for lunch, and typically closes at about 4pm on a weekday. You could be waiting about 15-30 minutes depending on the timeday you go because there is just one guy who makes the orders. He's fast, but his line can get long. Take it for what it is: Andy uses fresh and tasty fish. He cuts you big pieces for both his a la carte pieces and his rolls. He will make you any custom order you'd like provided he has the ingredients. He does have a limited selection of SushiSashimi platters. He has a good spider roll and after going a few times, definitely ask for the \"Chef's Special\" -- he just loads up a roll for you. You won't be disappointed.And, as for prices, it's the best bang for your buck for sushi. what more could you ask for.","product_id":"10","review_rating":3}

Have I mentioned that I am obsessed with yellowtail Ahhhh, the buttery-ness, the texture, the slight taste of the sea....oh wait, this isn't a review on a singular fish, i got a little carried away (even though Andy serves up some damn fine YT)!

My favorite appetizer is the agedashi tofu, though the others are good as well.  The atmosphere is great for everything from a casual lunch to a pre-Homecoming dinner.  The service is attentive, providing you with hot towels to clean your hands before dinner.

The owners are good friends of my family, from back when we lived in Pittsburgh.  I remember when they were first starting out--my dad helped design and build the sushi counter, and my mom made the original cushions and server uniforms.  One time, I had an epic wasabi-eating contest with the owner's son.  On many a weekend as a kid I would go and stuff my face with all the sushi I could eat.  I know for a fact they use the freshest fish. I may be biased, but I think my early experiences with massive-sushi-overload helped refine my tastebuds and make me the sushi snob I am today.

Our waitress was very friendly, fast, and helpful.","product_id":"4","review_rating":5}

I had my first taste of sushi at Lil Toks which is why it has become my benchmark.  Now I will say that I have had better sushi at a few places (Umi in Shadyside , PA and Coast in Chicago), but for what your paying at this place you cannot get a better value for the quality.  Those other places that I mention you'll definitely be paying alot more for marginally better sushi - at least in my opinion.  So whenever I'm in the mood for some sushi I come to this place.I should also mention that they have the most amazing fried ice cream...ever...even better than Chi Chi's fried ice cream (for those who remember).  People it's seriously that good!","product_id":"2","review_rating":4}

I've been coming here with a good friend for a few years, and it's a MUST every time I come back to town for a visit. On our most recent visit I had the sushi platter entree. It comes with 8 pieces of nigiri sushi and a maki roll in the middle. The salmon nigiri is incredible. Eat it slowly.  SAVOR it!  I'm thinking about going back just for that one more time before I head back to Arizona. Also, their desserts are exquisite.  The dessert menu changes, but again, I've never even come close to feeling disappointed.  I don't care much for sweets but the dessert here is SO good that I order something every time.  P.S.

{"review_title":"I believe I've found my new favorite restaurant. After...","review_body":"I believe I've found my new favorite restaurant. After being rather dissapointed with Chaya last night, I decided to go to Umi tonight.The staff was friendly and service perfect. There servers watch for you to dictate the pace of the meal.Beggining with the typical salad with ginger dressing: I was very happy with this dressing, just about perfect.Next the miso soup: I'm not generally a huge fan of miso soup, but this was probably the best preparation I've had. I could have gone for another bowl. For my entree I chose the dinner sushi assortment. This was by far the best sushi I've ever tasted. As cliche as it may sound, every piece (including fin which is notoriously tough) was melt in your mouth good.  The accompanying sauces are not overbearing in the least, they merely enhance the flavor of the fish.  The pieces of nigiri themselves are bite size - as in 1 bite without looking like you're stuffing your mouth.  This is smaller than the giant balls of rice with large cuts of fish you often times see at other places. I rather enjoyed the size, but just wanted to make note of it. The tuna roll was also very tasty. I did not sample any other rolls tonight, but I'm sure I will be back to do so.My dining companion had the chicken teriyaki.  The dish came out sizzeling from the back kitchen.  Again, this was probably the best preperation of the dish I've ever tasted. The serving size was perfect, about 5oz of very tender breast meat, with accompanying vegetables and a small side of rice.  More than enough to satiate, without the need for a nap afterwards. I didn't sample the desserts tonight, but I've seen others rave about them. I will definitely be back, as often as I can. I don't really care to try sushi anywhere else in Pittsburgh.","product_id":"10","review_rating":5}

Black cod with Miso: This fish was cooked perfectly and literally melted in the mouth. The flavor was mild and perfect. 2. Tuna Tataki: This was slices of Ahi Tuna slightly seared from the outside and rare in the inside. It was to die for!!! 3. Shrimp and Asparagus Maki roll: Probably not a great choice to begin with, this was okay, nothing to rave about. 4. Fuji Maki Roll: This had Crab and avocado and sesame seeds on the outside.

{"review_title":"Anyone who says that there's no good sushi in Pittsburgh...","review_body":"Anyone who says that there's no good sushi in Pittsburgh (and I've heard you say it, folks, right here on Yelp!) hasn't been to Umi yet. I'd been mostly satisfied, sushi-wise, by quality if standard places like Little Tokyo in the South Side and Chaya in Squirrel Hill before I went to Umi with my roommate last Saturday. The first major difference between Umi and the places mentioned above: price. Umi, a Big Burrito joint, is much more expensive than other sushi places in town. That said, if you have the dough, go for the $75person omakase. We enjoyed eight courses (7 dinner + 1 dessert course), each one subtle and well-seasoned and incredibly fresh. (Now we're broke, but that's my cross to bear.) The black cod and the nigiri course were stand-out favorites. The prices on the a-la-carte sushi, in contrast, looked only slightly more costly than others in town.The second difference: innovation. Sometimes, I just want straight-up, unadorned sushi, and when I do, I doubt I'll come back to Umi. However, if I'm looking for a fine dining experience, one where the ingredients are creative and innovative, I'll definitely return here. One of the best meals I've had in PGH yet!A final caveat: don't forget to make a reservation. The restaurant was packed when we were there, and due to its small size, I doubt they can squeeze too many walk-ins in on a busy night.","product_id":"8","review_rating":3}

They were not skimpy by any means, there was almost am entire roll left when I had to give up, so the man happily picked up the slack.

It's not so out-of-the-way that you have to travel to nightlife and not so on-the-scene that it would attract curious passers-by. I first visited this place to sample the Indian fare which had a good spin on the campus at CPCC. Of course I was drawn to the cliche 1950's pacific-rim archaeologist motif (fan-tan, folding fans, bamboo, etc.) but it was just slightly interesting as compared to the sushi menu, which was surprisingly diverse. The Maki rolls were above average and the Soundboy roll (spicy tuna or smoked salmon Philly tempura) was very good. They have a good selection of Japanese beer and the house sake is the only warm sake on the menu, so there is no immediate reason to order the fancy-pants selections, unless you are trying to impress someone - but that can easily backfire like a '79 Dodge Aspen going up a hill. Stick to what you know, or at least what you have learned so far. The Maki is solid and the Nagiri is good as well. The price is a little above average but you get a decent portion of good sushi. Try the Asahi bottled beer with the warm house sake. If you bring a date you can easily share. The Indian pancake is great for a shared appetizer. The Indian side of the menu is pretty good as well, so give it a shot on your following visit.I recommend Malaya overall for the sushi, location and atmosphere. Afterward, you can take the short drive Uptown and check out the scene.","product_id":"6","review_rating":3}

The peanut butter pancake dessert thingie is fun, too.  The Mango Chicken is aromatic and tasty, but I prefer their Rendang to anything else.  I think they do a fine job with the sushi and rolls as well.  I'm looking forward to trying other items here.  If you're not sure about this place, try it.

There is not a single person I have ever taken there that has not loved it, and become a regular patron. Even the \"standard\" Chinese Restaurant dishes are really good- Kung Pao Chicken or Shrimp, Chow Fun, and fried rice. Try the Roti Telur for an appetizer. It's a savory Curry Broth with potatoes (don't think of Indian Curry), it's mild and I think it tastes similar to Thai Massaman curry. Comes with homemade bread pancakes for dipping. Also the Beef Satay is very good.The wait staff is usually very helpful to new customers that are not familiar with the dishes.They do a great Lunch Menu and are very fast with service.Located next to CPCC campus downtown, this place is a must try!","product_id":"8","review_rating":4}

If Ian is in, ask for him to help you make your food selection. There is much that isn't on the menu. Ian is the bartender an server. He is Malay and speaks excellent English and has an amazing amount of knowledge about the culture and food influences throughout the SE Asian peninsula. Ian hooked us up last night with some outstanding Malay dishes. We had sea bass that was lightly battered with a mouth watering curry with eggplant, green beans, okra, and onions. The spices in this dish blended perfectly well and I began to understand some of the differences between Indonesian and Malay cuisine that Ian had tried to explain. We also had the beef rendang, that was tender and fragrant. This is slow cooked beef in coconut milk and spices. We topped off our meal with a Asian style flat pancake folded over some ground  peanuts and palm sugar that was grilled in a pan to blend the flavors and served with vanilla ice cream.  The only thing that could have enhanced this dish might be a drizzle of chocolate sauce. Yum!We look forward to returning and having Ian take care of us again.","product_id":"7","review_rating":4}

There is magic in the food and service! Orchids hang in boxes on the wall, there is a bar to sit at where the sushi chef rolls his art, and pop music plays on the speakers.  Once seated, we were almost immediately welcomed by our server Ian. Ladies and gentlemen, if you can request Ian upon arriving, DO IT! He is Malaysian and gives you a rundown of all of the cultures that contribute to Malay cuisine. This gives you an idea of some of the items that you would like to try. He also brought a sample of curry to gauge our tastes. After the sample, we practically put our faith in his hands and let him suggest whatever. My friend and I decided to go with the beef rendang (which is so good it will make you scream BOOYAH!) and  the basil duck. The basil duck was off the menu. It came with stir-fry style veggies and the duck on the side. Warning! This dish may make you moan like Homer Simpson. The duck is that good.

It is also a really good place to go with large groups because they have plenty of space, there is never a wait, and they can accommodate very large groups at one table. Also, the last 2 birthday celebrations we had there with large friend groups, we called in advance to make the reservation and let them know it was a birthday party, and they put up decorations in our area that we were seated at! That was definitely exemplary service.  They also let us bring our own birthday cake and kept it in the fridge in the back and then cut and served it for us after blowing out the candles.  Now on to the food.  The food is always so good.  They are also very large portions, so definitely can share one dish between 2 people.  The roti tellur appetizer is amazing and a must to order if you have never had it.  I also really like the kung pao tofu - the tofu has the perfect texture and crispness.

They came and figured out where to be and when to entertain.\"Belle\" came looking just as we expected and nothing less.  She looked good enough to be in Disney LandWorld live-action plays.  She talkedwalkedlooked like Belle.  Glitter Tattoo artist also came with her own chair and table and got her self set up in a convenient place and under the shade.Only thing was that the glitter tattoo artist came on time but forgot her glitter glue so she had to leave and come back.  She stayed past the original time to make up for the delay.  Regardless though, all the kids loved her and all the tattoos were done great.I would definitely encourage everyone to give this place a try.  They have a lot more than just glitter tattoo and characters.","product_id":"10","review_rating":5}

I am finally getting to writing a review because of a wonderful experience I had today.  I decided to take my two girls in for Valentine's day nail painting as a special treat.  My oldest went first and I was watching with my other daughter on my lap.  My youngest accidentally bumped a bottle of nail polish off the table which proceeded to smash all over the floor.  I was mortified.  They immediately began telling me \"don't worry, don't worry!\" And my daughter was looking pretty sad because she knew she messed up.  They were coming up to her and saying \"don't be sad, it's ok!\"  Afterward when they wanted to charge me next to nothing for doing the girls' nails, I wanted to leave a large tip as an apology and a thank you.  They wouldn't let me!  So of course I did anyway and just told the gals to split it.  I still feel terrible about the mess but am amazed at how nice they were about it.  Please go here and support these folks and their wonderful business!","product_id":"9","review_rating":4}

I did them Wednesday night and Thursday morning wanted them off. I was pressed for time because of work and bc of leaving for San Diego today (Friday).The owner and his wife were more than accommodating. He pushed back his gym session Thursday evening bc he knew this was a 'nail emergency' and his wife took over to do the nail art design. I had a picture from Pinterest that I showed them and they matched it as closely as possible, and it turned out very nice. I posted a picture (mine is the blue, gold glitter, and peacock feather).They were all very friendly and welcoming and you can tell they really enjoy doing nails-it shows in their work and what perfectionists they are.I asked how long they'd been there and he said since 2000 which was really surprising to me because the place is so clean it looks like they just opened.So, as a nail salon it really doesn't get much better than this.

However, it's pretty cool that she offers it.I was very happy with my brows and have since gone in for some of the facial with LED light treatment packages to reduce the age spots freckles on my face. The process of ridding some of the larger dark spots include burning them off and then staying OUT OF THE SUN while the skin heals back a lighter more blended tone to the rest of your face.

I got my eyebrows done by her about a year ago.Pros:- Min is very experienced  - Permanent makeup comes with 5 free appointments for touch ups - Competitive prices- Rooms are clean - Variety of services offered- Friendly and helpful staffConsultbefore the tattooing: An assistant draws in the shape you want with an eyeliner pencil. I did have some doubt right before I got my brows done. My natural eyebrows were very thin and each were very different in shape, length, etc, and it's always been difficult to draw them on evenly. But, the assistant was very patient and helpful and spent probably half an hour making my eyebrows the shape I wanted them. Getting them tattooed: Min, having been doing this for so long, is confident in what she does, so she does move a little fast. But be assured, she knows exactly what she's doing. I told her I was still a little unsure of the shape of my right brow but she said not to worry, she would fix it, and she picked a color that would look good on me. Obviously when you're about to have something tattooed onto your face, you want to be 100% sure about everything before you start. I had a little doubt about the shape of the right brow and if the color was too dark, but I couldn't be more happy with the results. My brows look very natural and people are surprised when I tell them they're tattooed because of how subtle and natural they are. OVERALL: Would recommend! Experienced and friendly. Great prices.

After my first visit, I was completely transformed. I swear I looked like a different person! The attention, care and great price cannot be matched anywhere in this town.  I believe a cutcolor from Kim is reasonably priced given the competition (she smokes them!) and the quality of service she provides. Kim has been my stylist for eight years now and I can't even imagine going to anyone else - it would totally feel like cheating. I have never had a bad haircut or color.

Tammy has taken my hair from major BLEH to people think my hair looks amazing 6 months+ after its been done by Tammy. Perfect color, perfect cuts EVERY TIME. I guess what spurned this review after so long(I've been her client for a few years) is that I just had my hair done here in San Diego by someone else and I almost cried when he took the towel off my head. The color was NOT right. He used the bleach for the highlights but totally effed up my low-lights (Tammy, if you are reading this, I'm coming in in January...I need you). They do not match my hair AT ALL. My sister and mom go to Tammy as well. They came down to see me for Thanksgiving last week, took one look at my hair and said...why is it orange You need to go see Tammy ASAP. To top it off, he cut these randoms bits of my hair different odd lengths \"to make it healthy\" so my hair looks all choppy and short in some places and long in others. It's just awful. And if you've seen my profile pic, you'll see my hair and see how beautiful it is thanks only to Tammy (pic was taken in February, 2 months after she did it). So it's true folks. Tammy is a miracle worker. She's fixed my hair before when its been botched by these people here in SD and I'm sure this won't be the last time she'll have to do it. She's also incredibly smart, interesting, funny and will always make you feel better about yourself after sitting in her chair for a few hours. It's like a therapy session + hair therapy session...what could be better And don't even let me forget her head massages...OMG. I gotta stop here because now, Tammy is going to be busier than ever. Love love love you Tammy!UPDATE (1112012): I still go to Tammy even though I don't live in Las Vegas anymore. I have 100% complete faith in her and will never go see anyone else.","product_id":"3","review_rating":4}

The salon is higher end and quite nice, the staff were friendly and nice, Cindie was there ready for me. The room was very clean and comfortable.

Joanne was amazingly kind, accommodating, and responsive to all of my complicated appointment booking needs (I reside in Flagstaff and wished to make the trip to Surprise just for Theresa's permanent makeup artistry) and Theresa simply has to be the very best in the business! Not only was the procedure for permanent eyeliner and brows discussed thoroughly with me prior to choosing a single color, I was made to feel completely at ease and fully confident in my choice to proceed. As one would expect from a talent like Theresa, the results of my permanent makeup are absolutely perfect and, simply put, stunning. In fact, I was making my way through a local grocery store less than 30 minutes post procedure and was stopped twice in the aisles for compliments on the color of my eyes.

My friend and I decided to get our nails done after school so we looked for a Groupon and found Holly's Nail & Spa. We purchased our Groupon's and called to book an appointment for almond acrylic sets. We found pictures of what we wanted and showed our nail technicians, Susan and Holly. They were very polite, patient and made sure we had a mutual understanding of what us the clients were wanting. Throughout the manicures they were very thorough and held conversations with us. I enjoyed conversating with my technician, Holly, she was fun and very energetic while she gave me my manicure. Once she finished shaping my nails and lead me to the washing station I glanced at my nails and my mouth dropped. I have NEVER hady nails look so perfect in my entire life. Each nails was perfectly even, smooth, and the exact shape I wanted (mind you this was before they were polished and designed). Soon after my friend Devon texted me saying \"OMG I'm in love\"! Once Holly began polishing she coated each nail multiple times and very evenly. I had asked for glitter on my index finger, thinking it was extra, to my surprise it was not! I am just in shock at how gorgeous my nails look and Holly will be my new nail technician for as along as I live in Arizona. Thank you again Holly and Susan, and I will be returning soon.

I was fortunate that the lady I picked to do them for me in Tempe was pretty good. The shape was something I could live with but the color turned reddish brown, not good for my skin tone. I had her touch them up a year later and again, I could live with the result because no brow is going to be knockout amazing, right In a couple of years I got lip and eyeliner done. The lip liner I am totally happy with, the eyeliner was spotty and a bit uneven in places, but eyeliner rocks! Last year I found Denise when she ran a special on eyeliner. She redid mine, evened out the rough spots and recommended that I go darker than what I asked for. She was right and it looks wonderful. I finally decided recently that my brows had faded way too much to be ok, I was forced to fill in with pencil each day, which to me is why I got permanent brows in the first place, so that makeup application wasn't necessary every day, right So I called Denise who happened to be running another special, and set up an appointment to do my brows last Thursday at noon. She had me draw the shape plus bring the pencil so she could be sure to match the shade. When I got home I couldn't stop staring at them in the mirror. The lines were so nice, they looked awesome. Plus all the red tone was gone, none peeking through. Today is Tuesday. I took good care to maintain a light layer of Vaseline and didn't rub. This evening they are done, fully shed and beautiful. I couldn't be happier. They are amazing, the color is perfect and they look so good I won't need to fill with pencil.When I'm ready, I will go back for an eyeliner refresher. Denise gets my business.

She is located at the district, in green valley. She is room number 9 **inside** of Sola salon behind the cheesecake factory.As soon as I walked into the lobby, she was drawn to me. She was warm, friendly and introduced herself. We went into her personal room, which is glass (she has privacy drapes). She sat me down in a very comfortable recliner, and told me a little about herself before we started to discuss my mistake.....I mean, tattoo.Julianne is certified in micro-pigmentation, which means she knows a lot about skin. She is a member of the SPCP (http:www.spcp.orgthinking-of-getting-a-cosmetic-tattoofind-a-technician).She does tattoo removal with natural saline. The saline removal process is a non-laser ink extraction  alternative, very similar to the regular tattoo process in that it uses similar equipment and procedures.  But instead of pushing ink into the skin, the saline removal system uses a special solution - mostly of sea salt -to create an osmotic condition. As the cells lift due to osmosis, they push the ink  into the scab and out of the skin. Saline tattoo removal generally requires 50% to 75% fewer treatments than laser tattoo removal, and unlike laser removal -- which relies on wavelengths to target  only specific colors -- saline tattoo removal method is effective on all colors of ink and on all areas of the body. (http:dragonflyink.comtattoo-removal)I have been nervous with laser, seeing as how it actually burns skin.She told me that she would work on a few 2 inch sections at a time, so that my body could heal properly and deal with the scabs correctly...about 5 weeks. She would also numb the area as well. Normally, she only does small tattoos (my tattoo is 30 square inches), but she told me she is willing to work with me, and that if I am willing to commit, so is she. At $100 an hour, my husband and I feel that this is a better way then $400 a session laser that will take 7-12 sessions.I can not wait to schedule with her in these next few weeks!She is a true gem personality wise, and I can't wait to work with her. She seems to really care about who she does procedures on, and what she does. I read the filtered review on this place, and it seems very positive.I will do updates!","product_id":"5","review_rating":3}

She takes her tattoo gun, and dips it into a solution of saline. With the pain medicine, I was very comfortable...of course, there were some tender spots (it's just like getting the tattoo all over again.) We are doing two small sections, with two different solutions to see which one works better with my skin, and how I heal with them. We will of course use the one that is most effective. Unlike laser, it is not a \"one size\" fits all approach! She sends me off with a care package, and very detailed instructions on how to treat the wound for proper healing. We have had communication, making sure that I am doing well... I don't even get that from my doctor!Today, is the second day with the wound, and it is sensitive to touch, and some clothing.. like my bra because of it's location.

There is a pin up feel to this room....risque pictures included ! ;)My first session a few months ago was a \"test\" strip, testing two different solutions to see which one worked more effectively with my skin type and the mistake.................I mean, tattoo. **Once again**I am warmly greeted by Julianne. She had ran out to get an ultra soft blanket for my support (and was still on time!)**Once again**Before pulling out utensils, Julianne examines the previously treated spot, addresses my questionsconcerns. **Once again**It is all about ME. My comfort and what would help make our session more productive. Our first session had me on my side, and this time I was on my stomach. Julianne also gets me in the \"mood\" with music.....music that I actually like. No elevator or country music here ! (by my choice, I'm sure if you wanted country, or classical, she would pull up Pandora for you....Which she offered to do for me).How can I not get in the mood of tattoo removal when JayZ and Drake is on!! LOL.((Something new!)) She now has a comfort fishy! Luckily, I used her pinky fishy to have more support for my neckhead, and fishy didn't have to soak up any of my tears. ((something new!)) The recliner is gone. In its' place is a new chair, that reminds me of one at the dentist's office. In a faboosh SNAKE print, of course! **Once again**clean, and sterile tools are open in front of me, with Julianne putting on a fresh pair of gloves. The products she used on me were fresh, she mixed them in front of me...They haven't been sitting around for hours, or days.The anticipation is almost worse than the actual pain. We start with a numbing process, and get to work. Julianne takes my mind off the pain by having great conversation. I don't think there was a thing that we DIDN'T talk about today...haha. Which is awesome. Who wants to sit in silence when you're getting needles dug into you, and salt solution pumped inside you That would be awkward and painful!My pictures are posted. The letters (that have a pinkpurple circle around them) are almost invisible. This is their second treatment. The center looks like a big mass of sunscreen, but that is a salt solution that we decided to leave on. I would rather have a warm, friendly, consistent, thoughtful, professional, quirky longer removal process than to have a quick solution and be treated like some cash cow number. And I'd rather not have my super fair skin burned up by a laser. Well, now that I've confessed my strange love for Julianne.....More updates, and pictures to come!THANKS AGAIN JULIANNE!!!!*****1062014********It has been brought to my attention that Mrs. Julianne has bought a laser and will have it up and running in December !

And Julianne really understood that. I would recommend her for any tattoo removal, permanent eyeliner, tattoo eyebrows, and so much more of the things that she is able to do. We played around with make up application and she made me look so wonderful. I would give anything to be as skilled as she is.

Like long, sweeping bangs that fell right and made all my friends say, \"I wish I could pull of bangs!\"I LOVE THIS PLACE.  They moved to Lawrenceville a few years ago, and I havent been to the new salon yet bc its been that long since I've had my haircut which is so sad.  It's like witch craft, what they do with hair, and I need some magic.I highly recommend this salon.","product_id":"3","review_rating":4}

I found myself there shoeless with an overheated dog and they had no problem letting me come in with the dog to buy some water for him.  It is rare for a big chain store to be so dog and barefoot friendly!","product_id":"6","review_rating":3}

The girls Lisa and Ann are extremely professional with their customers. For example I get courtesy calls reminding me of special limited offers for face cleanser and serums. One time I received a call from Ann that they just received a special shipment of only a handful of gift sets for the holidays and that they could put one on hold for me. Since this stuff is pricey, the associates make sure that your money is well spent. They even help with the fragrances too. Got several men's fragrancees (Polo red, Aqua Di Gio, John Paul Gultier, CK Euphoria, Dolce and Gabana Sport) and complimentary body wash, duffle bags, and trial bottles too. The Boston Store charge card is also nice because you can save on luxury items that never go on sale like cosmetics and fragrance. So all in all I base the ratings just on the two departments I visit most often. This is not the typical department store that I am used to for clothes or shoes since it caters mostly to older folks but that's ok. I don't go to Boston Store for clothes or shoes. Home decor isn't too bad either. Saw several glass Santas and nativity sets that would look great if only I had more space","product_id":"7","review_rating":4}

I recently moved to DC and have let my hair go for 6 months because I knew I'd be back home in Madison around Christmas and could sneak into Ultimate and get my hair done right.When I first started going to Tiffany, I did what every girl does post-break-up.  I sat in her chair and told her I didn't care what she did with my hair but that I needed something different.  She gave me the perfect cut and color.  I was stopped multiple times by strangers asking me where I had gotten my hair cut.  It was stylish and professional - plus, I could just blow dry it into shape, no need to curl or use a straightening iron.Love this place!","product_id":"9","review_rating":5}

She's great and always makes me hair better than I imagined. The salon is nice. Other reviews say they are pricey but you get what you pay for. I get a paraffin dip and neckscalp massage when I get my hair done. I'm not sitting there all day like other places. The front desk is very friendly and I even get mailed coupons for discounted services. I will be going back as long as I'm living in Madison. :)","product_id":"2","review_rating":4}

She's the only one I'll let touch my hair and I always leave feeling like a million bucks!  Not only is she a wonderful stylist, she's become a good friend of mine and I don't think I'm the only client of hers that feels that way.","product_id":"4","review_rating":5}
{"review_title":"My sister and I decided to give our mom a complete...","review_body":"My sister and I decided to give our mom a complete \"makeover\" as a gift. I called multiple salons to inquire if they would be able to strip color out of my mom's hair. (She decided to stop coloring her hair and let her hair grow out, so she had greywhite on top and dark brown a few inches down.)Many of the salons said that it could not be done. When I spoke with someone at the Ultimate Spa Salon, they stated that they would be able to lighten the color so it would blend better with her natural hair color. The stylist was very nice, discussed what she was going to be doing.  She put lightener on my mom's hair a few times. I was nervous that it wasn't going to work.  She got a new hairstyle, and when it was all done, she looked FABULOUS!  I was very pleased with how it came out.  It was pricey to have it done, but when it comes to a drastic change, I'd say it's worth it!","product_id":"3","review_rating":5}

I arrived at Perry Monge flumoxed and in a bad mood--a special event meant that all nearby lots cost $12 for parking. Spending $12 for parking is spendy for a day in San Francisco...but in Phoenix for an hour Please. I mentioned this to the poised woman at the check-in desk who said that next time I should park in the lot at their building where they validated parking. She then brough out a yummy iced tea for me to sip while filling out the new client form. I went to the bathroom, which featured a delightful scented candle, and then Sandy () brought me to the changing room and then my chair. A surprise: shortly after sitting down in the barber chair a woman brought me over to have my shampoo--and gave me a brief massage first. The massageshampoo woman had a very positive energy to her. Marina cut my hair and, although she was not much of a talker, was upbeat and gave me a great cut. I've been looking for a great place in Phoenix and found it. No one will ever compare to my beloved Cid at Barbarella in San Francisco, but I do have a new favorite salon locally in the Valley of the Sun.","product_id":"6","review_rating":4}

Whenever I walk out of there I cannot believe how my hair looks, and I oftern get complete strangers complimenting my cut.  Perry does a great job of taking my preferences and developing cuts that flatter me. What more can I askThe  massage before the shampoo is standard and more than once I've fallen asleep.  Once a couple years ago, in the late afernoon of a particularly frustrating day at work, they asked if I wanted anything to drink.  I said, only if you have vodka.  Next thing I know, a clear drink on ice shows up...and tasted suspiciously like vodka.  No that's customer service.","product_id":"7","review_rating":4}

The entire staff is friendly and makes you feel right at home.  Marina is amazing with hair...I only wish she could style my hair every morning!  The extra perks beyond an amazing hair cut are the chair massage before your wash and the hand massage during your cut!  I spend 75% of my time in Dallas and 25% of my time in Phoenix, but insist on only having my hair cut at Perry Monge!","product_id":"4","review_rating":4}

Being in Phoenix and having plenty of Aveda salons around you would think I'd be beauty-heaven. But when I left Cleveland I was very hesitant to leave my hairdresser so I scheduled my hair appointments around when I'd be flying home. Well, as one could image, that become very expensive, so I finally decided to take a chance with Perry Monage downtown. I'm so glad I did! From the moment I walked in to the stylist, they were spot-on with customer service and they did an amazing job with my cut and color, too! There was a little up-selling me with products which I wasn't use to and I must admit, I did cave but I mean, Aveda, hello Can we say amazing!I'm still in love with Aveda and I'm now in love with Perry Monage.","product_id":"8","review_rating":5}

I went to my Aveda store to pick up some products and there was a stylist from Perry Monge, Marie Luce ( sp) gave me a coupon for 20.00 off so I decided to give it a try.OMG. From the moment I walked in I felt like royalty. I think I was getting the first timeservice but not only did I get one of the best haircuts, a styling, a 5 minute back massage, a very thorough hand massage, a facial ( yep),eyebrow waxing, a make-up refresher and an iced cappuccino. I wound up buying 3 products but I always buy something Aveda when I go so it wasn't a hard sell.I love my new look-my skin looks amazing and the total cost was 122.00 What! I had a 20.00 off coupon but still....It was brilliant marketing. I have found a new stylist and I will be faithful in getting a facial each time I go because it's so worth it. I highly recommend Marie Luce, she is amazing!","product_id":"1","review_rating":5}

Tell her what you want, and she will give you ideas and suggestions. She won't push anything, including products. Though the products she recommends are always topnotch.

If you are Latina, have curly hair, and cannot find anyone to cut your hair andor style it because of the curl, this is your place!  Saturdays are busy, but I try to avoid them.  I am lucky, I work downtown so I am able to make an appt. right after work and not have to deal with the craziness of Saturdays.  Being a client for so long, I have tried their spa, waxing services, and of course hair services, and and happy with everything!  I have even recommended this salon to many friends and family, all of whom are still loyal clients.  An added bonus, my husband and I joined the Aveda Pure Privilege program, it took us approx. 4 years of saving our points, but in 2011, we had a 6 night stay in Jamaica!  It was absolutely wonderful.  We stayed at the Caves in Negril complete with complimentary massages.  Since then we have saved another 44,000 points and are looking forward to booking our 3 night stay in Antigua next year when we reach 50,000 points.","product_id":"1","review_rating":3}
